## ✅ CONSISTENT ELEMENTS

### 1. Hypothesis Definitions (H0.1, H0.2, H0.3, H3.4, H3.5)
All shared hypotheses have **identical** status, confidence, and priority:
- **H0.1**: Status "Unknown", Confidence 50%, Priority URGENT ✅
- **H0.2**: Status "Supported", Confidence 95%, Priority URGENT ✅
- **H0.3**: Status "Pending Verification", Confidence 55%, Priority URGENT ✅
- **H3.4**: Status "Pending Verification", Confidence 75% (conditional), Priority URGENT ✅
- **H3.5**: Status "Emerging Pattern", Confidence 70%, Priority HIGH ✅

### 2. Core Data Points
Both files agree on:
- Core Y-DNA comparator set: Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw
- Doug as potential 5th comparator (pending Big Y-700)
- TMRCA estimates (~300 years, ~1725 CE for Doug)

### 3. Contact Information
- Judith Skory (primary contact)
- Doug Skory email: dskory1820@aol.com
- Timeline: Big Y-700 funded Feb 2022, last contact Nov 2022

## ⚠️ INCONSISTENCIES FOUND

### 1. **Title Mismatch** (Minor)
**Location:**
- `HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` line 1: "Radzimowski-Garboś-Mazgaj-Berezhnoy Investigation"
- `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` line 1: "Radzimowski-Garboś-Mazgaj-Berezhnoy-Skory Investigation"

**Issue:** Main hypothesis file title doesn't include "Skory" despite having Tier 0 Skory integration.

**Recommendation:** Update `HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` title to include Skory for consistency.

---

### 2. **"Fourth Data Point" vs "Fifth Comparator"** (Terminology Confusion)
**Location:**
- `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` line 9: "critical **fourth data point**"
- `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` line 22: "**fourth complete SNP dataset**"
- `HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` line 26: "adding a **fifth modern comparator**"
- `HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` line 784: "Doug becomes a **fifth comparator**"

**Issue:** Inconsistent counting terminology. If core set = 4 (Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw), then Doug = 5th. But `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` calls him "fourth data point."

**Possible Explanation:** 
- "Fourth data point" might refer to Skory as the 4th **family** (after Radzimowski, Garboś, Mazgaj/Berezhnoy)
- "Fifth comparator" refers to Doug as the 5th **individual** in the Y-DNA comparison set

**Recommendation:** Clarify terminology:
- Use "fifth Y-DNA comparator" for Doug (consistent with 4 core + 1 pending)
- Use "fourth family" if referring to Skory as a family unit
- Add a note explaining the distinction

### 3. **"Third Ukrainian Migration Branch" Terminology** (Needs Clarification)
**Location:**
- `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` line 13: "**Third Independent Ukrainian Migration Branch**"
- `HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` line 325: "Establishes a **third migration branch**"

**Issue:** What are the first two branches?
- **Branch 1:** Berezhnoy (H3.3) - Poland → Ukraine → Germany/Russia ✅
- **Branch 2:** ??? (Not clearly identified)
- **Branch 3:** Skory (H3.4) - Poland → Ukraine → USA ✅

**Possible Interpretations:**
1. If counting only **completed/confirmed** branches: Berezhnoy = 1st, Skory = 2nd (not "third")
2. If counting **potential** branches: Berezhnoy = 1st, Radzimowski collateral lines = 2nd (hypothetical), Skory = 3rd
3. If counting **documented** branches: Berezhnoy = 1st, ??? = 2nd, Skory = 3rd

**Recommendation:** Clarify in both files:
- Option A: Change "Third" to "Second" if only counting confirmed branches (Berezhnoy + Skory)
- Option B: Explicitly list all three branches: "Berezhnoy, [Second Branch Name], and Skory"
- Option C: Use "Additional Ukrainian Migration Branch" instead of numbered position

### 4. **H3.5 Dependency Statement** (Minor Wording Difference)
**Location:**
- `HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` line 331: "Confidence: 70% **(dependent on H3.4 confirmation)**"
- `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` line 95: "Confidence: 70%" (no dependency stated)

**Issue:** `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` doesn't explicitly state dependency on H3.4, though it's implied.

**Recommendation:** Add dependency statement to `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` for clarity.

---

### 5. **TMRCA Calculation Reference** (Minor)
**Location:**
- `HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` line 502: "With comparable Y-STR or SNP data from **all four individuals**"
- `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` line 115: "Calculate multi-way TMRCA (**core four**; include Doug when Big Y is confirmed)"

**Issue:** Both refer to "four" but should clarify: 4 core (Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw) + Doug (pending) = 5 total when complete.

**Recommendation:** Clarify: "four core individuals" or "four confirmed comparators" to distinguish from potential 5th (Doug).

---

### 6. **Last Updated Dates** (Minor)
**Location:**
- `HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` line 3: "**Last Updated:** January 2026 (SNP/STR/YFull alignment)"
- `HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` line 2: "## Last Updated: January 10, 2026"

**Issue:** Different date precision (month vs. specific date).

**Recommendation:** Standardize date format (prefer specific date: "January 10, 2026").

---

## 📋 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED FIXES

### High Priority:
1. ✅ **Clarify "Third Ukrainian Migration Branch"** - Explicitly list all branches or change to "Second" if only counting confirmed
2. ✅ **Standardize counting terminology** - Use "fifth Y-DNA comparator" consistently, clarify "fourth family" vs "fifth individual"

### Medium Priority:
3. ✅ **Update HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md title** - Add "Skory" to title for consistency
4. ✅ **Add H3.5 dependency statement** - Include "(dependent on H3.4 confirmation)" in HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md
5. ✅ **Clarify TMRCA references** - Use "four core individuals" or "four confirmed comparators"

### Low Priority:
6. ✅ **Standardize date format** - Use "January 10, 2026" in both files

## ✅ OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Logical Consistency:** **GOOD** ✅

The files are **substantially consistent** with only minor terminology and clarity issues. No **contradictory facts** or **conflicting hypotheses** were found. All inconsistencies are:
- Terminology/clarity issues (not logical contradictions)
- Minor formatting differences
- Missing clarifications (not errors)

**Recommendation:** Apply the fixes above to improve clarity and consistency, but the files are **functionally consistent** and can be used as-is.
