# Consistency Analysis: Hypothesis Files + Bodzia Report

**Analysis Date:** 2026-01-11  
**Files Analyzed:**
- `docs/HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md`
- `docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md`
- `docs/ALEKSEI_EMAIL_ANALYSIS_2026.md`
- `docs/BODZIA_COMPLETE_TREE_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## ✅ Consistent Elements

### 1. Core Y-DNA framing and hypothesis set
Across `docs/HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md`, `docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md`, and `docs/ALEKSEI_EMAIL_ANALYSIS_2026.md`, the following are consistent:

- Core Y-DNA comparator set (confirmed): Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw
- Doug Skory as a potential fifth comparator once Big Y-700 exists (H0.1)
- January 2026 update from Aleksei: Doug Big Y-700 not ordered; Wladyslaw and Doug Y-STR distances reported; Aleksei surprised by the I‑Y224059 age refinement on YFull
- Hypothesis numbering is aligned for H0.1/H0.2/H0.3/H1.1/H1.4/H1.5/H3.4/H3.5 (same IDs, same intent)

### 2. Shared hypothesis statuses/confidences (current state)
The “Skory integration” and “Aleksei email” updates are already incorporated into the master list, and match the dedicated Skory and email-analysis documents:

- H0.1: Big Y-700 not completed; confidence reduced to 25%
- H1.4: Wladyslaw placement likely within I‑Y45113; confidence raised to 78% after STR distances
- H1.5: Proposed Wladyslaw ↔ Doug sub-branch hypothesis exists (pending haplotype comparison)
- H3.4/H3.5: Skory migration branch and “three parallel branches” are framed as conditional/pattern-level hypotheses

### 3. Bodzia treatment is directionally consistent with the hypotheses
`docs/BODZIA_COMPLETE_TREE_DOCUMENTATION.md` is careful about:
- Exploratory vs publication-grade inference
- “Affinity” vs “direct descent”

That matches the caution in `docs/HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` around Bodzia (e.g., “affinity signal is not proof of direct descent”).

## ⚠️ Inconsistencies / Gaps

### 1. Place-name spelling drift (fixed where it mattered most)
The hypothesis documents previously mixed `Trzemesno` and `Trzemeszno` for the same town.

- `Trzemeszno` is now consistently used in `docs/HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` and `docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md`.
- `docs/ALEKSEI_EMAIL_ANALYSIS_2026.md` already used `Trzemeszno`.

Recommendation: Keep `Trzemeszno` as the canonical spelling, and only deviate when quoting a source verbatim.

### 2. Over-specific confidence qualifier in H3.4 (fixed)
`docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` previously tied H3.4’s confidence to Doug being specifically `I‑Y45233`, while `docs/HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` treated the confidence as conditional on Big Y confirmation under the broader I‑Y45113 framework.

This is now aligned: H3.4 confidence is conditional on Big Y-700 confirmation under I‑Y45113.

### 3. Bodzia findings aren’t fully “fed back” into the hypothesis list
`docs/BODZIA_COMPLETE_TREE_DOCUMENTATION.md` includes Y-DNA calls for the two Bodzia males:
- VK157: `I1‑S2077`
- VK156: `R1a` (reported as `R1a‑SUR51`)

But `docs/HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` still frames the Bodzia link (H1.3) as needing Y-haplogroup confirmation for Bodzia samples relative to I‑Y45113, without explicitly incorporating the above calls.

Recommendation: Update H1.3 to cite these two haplogroup calls as evidence (even if only “broad-level, non-matching unless proven otherwise”), and adjust confidence accordingly.

### 4. “Comparator count” terminology can still be confusing
`docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md` mixes:
- Doug as the “critical fifth comparator” (individual count)
- Skory as a “fourth family” (family count)

Recommendation: Add a 1-line glossary note in both hypothesis docs:
- “Comparator” = individual Y-DNA sample
- “Family” = documentary surname/lineage unit

---

## Recommended Next Edits (High Signal)

1. Update `docs/HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` H1.3 (Bodzia) to incorporate VK156/VK157 haplogroup calls from `docs/BODZIA_COMPLETE_TREE_DOCUMENTATION.md`.
2. Add a short “terminology note” (comparator vs family) to `docs/HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md` and `docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md`.
3. Standardize “Last Updated” date precision across the hypothesis docs (either month-only or ISO date), to avoid implying different evidence cutoffs.

## Overall Assessment

**Consistency:** Good. The documents do not contradict each other on major facts; inconsistencies are mainly terminology, spelling drift, and a few places where newer evidence (Bodzia) hasn’t been propagated into the hypothesis list.
