# The Northern Hypothesis: A Third Cluster?

**Purpose:** Focused, stand-alone presentation on the **Northern Radzimowski Cluster in Tczew County** and its potential connection to the **Ciepłe elite cemetery** and the **"Dual-Wing" theory**.

**Status:** Testable hypothesis, **not** a proven claim.

**Recommended Length:** ~8-10 slides (10-15 minutes)

## Slide 1: Title & Hook

**Title:** The Northern Hypothesis: A Third Cluster?

**Visual:**  
Recreate the attached slide style:
- Old-map background of northern Poland
- Large title at the top: "The Northern Hypothesis: A Third Cluster?"
- Big red star on **Tczew County**
- Label for **Ciepłe Cemetery (Elite Danish Connection, 980-1020 CE)**

**Key Text (short):**
- Tczew County: Radzimowski records 1653-1934  
- Ciepłe Cemetery: Elite Danish-sphere site, 980-1020 CE  
- Question: Did a Radzimowski branch go north and join these elites?

**Speaker Notes (30-45 sec):**  
"This presentation is about one very specific question: did a branch of our Radzimowski line go north, into Tczew County, and possibly intersect with the elite warriors buried at Ciepłe? We already know a lot about the southern Podkarpackie cluster. Here, we zoom in on a potential **third cluster** in northern Poland and a new, testable hypothesis that links it to the Danish-sphere elites at Ciepłe."

## Slide 2: Where Is Tczew County?

**Title:** Tczew County: The Northern Anchor

**Visual:**  
- Zoomed-in map of **Pomeranian Voivodeship**
- Highlight **Tczew County**
- Mark towns: Piaseczno, Gniew, Dzierżążno, Nowa Cerkiew, Sztum, Pelplin, Wielki Garc, Wielkie Walichnowy

**Bullet Points:**
- Northern Poland, **Pomeranian Voivodeship**
- Key focus area: **Tczew County**
- Multiple Radzimowski records from **1653-1934** (Geneteka)
- Clearly separated geographically from the **Podkarpackie** cluster

**Speaker Notes (45 sec):**  
"Tczew County sits in northern Poland, in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. When we search parish indexes like Geneteka, we don't just see Radzimowski families in the south—we also see a distinct concentration here. Records from 1653 through 1934 point to multiple Radzimowski occurrences in this small area. Geographically, this is far from the better-known Podkarpackie cluster, which suggests we may be looking at either an **independent lineage** or an **older branch** of the same bigger story."

## Slide 3: The Northern Radzimowski Records

**Title:** Radzimowski in the North (1653-1934)

**Visual:**  
- Simple table or timeline showing:
  - 1653 – earliest Radzimowski record in Tczew County
  - 18th-19th century peaks
  - 1934 – latest recorded occurrence

**Bullet Points:**
- **Locations:** Piaseczno, Gniew, Dzierżążno, Nowa Cerkiew, Sztum, Pelplin
- **Source:** Geneteka parish indexes (Polish genealogy database)
- **Pattern:** Repeated Radzimowski appearances in the same small region
- **Interpretation:** Likely a **stable, long-term northern cluster**

**Speaker Notes (45-60 sec):**  
"When we look at the data, we find Radzimowski entries in several parishes across Tczew County: Piaseczno, Gniew, Dzierżążno, Nowa Cerkiew, Sztum, and Pelplin. These records stretch from 1653 all the way into the early 20th century. That kind of continuity usually means we're not dealing with a one-off migration, but with a **local lineage**. The question is whether this northern lineage ties into our known I-Y45113 line at all—and if so, **where**."

## Slide 4: Ciepłe Cemetery: Elite Danish Connection

**Title:** Ciepłe Cemetery (980-1020 CE)

**Visual:**  
- Map showing:
  - **Ciepłe** marked near **Gniew**
  - Bodzia marked ~150 km to the southeast
- Icon for "elite warrior graves"

**Bullet Points:**
- **Location:** Ciepłe, near Gniew, Tczew County
- **Period:** ~980-1020 CE
- **Site Type:** Elite settlement & cemetery
- **Findings:**
  - Richly furnished **chamber graves**
  - **Scandinavian (Danish) origins** confirmed by strontium isotopes
  - Administrative tools (scales, touchstones) → **tax/tribute collection**

**Speaker Notes (60 sec):**  
"Ciepłe is one of the most important early medieval sites in northern Poland. It was active around 980 to 1020 CE, exactly the same era as Bodzia in central Poland. Excavations revealed chamber graves with high-status warriors, rich grave goods, and clear indications that some of these men were of **Scandinavian—specifically Danish—origin**. Tools linked to taxation and precious metal testing show that this wasn't just a village; it was an **elite administrative node** in the Piast realm."

## Slide 5: The Dual-Wing Theory

**Title:** Dual-Wing Theory: Bodzia & Ciepłe

**Visual:**  
- Schematic diagram:
  - Left: **Bodzia = Rus' Wing**
  - Right: **Ciepłe = Danish Wing**
  - Arrows pointing into Piast Poland

**Bullet Points:**
- **Bodzia** (central Poland)
  - Elite burials linked to **Rus' networks**
  - VK157 with Y-DNA I1-S2077, phylogenetically upstream of **I-Y45113**
- **Ciepłe** (northern Poland)
  - Elite burials linked to **Danish/Scandinavian networks**
- **Dual-Wing Idea:**
  - Rus'-aligned elites (Bodzia)
  - Danish-aligned elites (Ciepłe)
  - Both integrated into early **Piast** power structure

**Speaker Notes (60 sec):**  
"One way to understand these two sites is as **two wings** of the same early Piast strategy. Bodzia appears connected to the Rus' political sphere; Ciepłe to the Danish sphere. Both bring foreign elites into Piast service. Our broader research already frames Bodzia as a possible Rus'-side connection to our I-Y45113 lineage. The northern hypothesis now asks whether the **Danish-side wing at Ciepłe** could be connected too, but through a **northern Radzimowski branch** rather than the southern one."

## Slide 6: Linking Tczew County and Ciepłe

**Title:** Same County, Different Centuries

**Visual:**  
- Overlaid map:
  - Mark **Ciepłe** and **Gniew**
  - Mark **Radzimowski parishes** in the same region
  - Use timeline bar: 980-1020 CE vs. 1653-1934

**Bullet Points:**
- **Shared geography:**
  - Ciepłe site and later Radzimowski parishes are in **the same county/region**
- **Time gap:** ~650-900 years between Ciepłe burials and earliest Radzimowski records
- **Hypothesis:** Later Radzimowski families may descend from:
  - Local populations formerly integrated with Ciepłe elites, or
  - Newcomers who filled the same strategic region **after** the Ciepłe phase

**Speaker Notes (45-60 sec):**  
"It's crucial not to overstate the link: we are separated by several centuries. However, it is striking that **the same small region**—Gniew and the surrounding parishes—hosts both Ciepłe's elite burials in 980-1020 CE and the Radzimowski surname from 1653 onward. The northern hypothesis doesn't claim direct descent from named warriors in Ciepłe. Instead, it asks whether the later Radzimowski line in Tczew County might trace back to a **population shaped by, or descended from, those same elite networks**."

## Slide 7: The Genetic Question

**Title:** Can the Northern Cluster Connect to I-Y45113?

**Visual:**  
- Simple Y-DNA tree fragment:
  - I1 → I1-S2077 → … → I-Y49957 → I-Y45113
- Mark:
  - VK157 (Bodzia) at I1-S2077
  - Modern line at I-Y45113
  - "Unknown" for any northern Radzimowski yet

**Bullet Points:**
- Our modern cluster: **I-Y45113** (with southern branches like I-Y224059)
- Bodzia: VK157 at **I1-S2077**, phylogenetically upstream
- **Northern cluster:** No Y-DNA data yet
- Key question:  
  - Do northern Radzimowski males belong to **I-Y45113** (or close neighbours),  
  - Or to a completely different haplogroup?

**Speaker Notes (45-60 sec):**  
"Genetically, the whole hypothesis stands or falls on one basic test: what Y-DNA haplogroup do northern Radzimowski males carry? If they're I-Y45113 or a close neighbour, then the northern cluster likely belongs to the same broad lineage as our southern cousins, opening the door to a deeper Ciepłe connection. If they carry something completely unrelated, then the hypothesis is **falsified for this surname**, and Ciepłe would be telling a different story."

## Slide 8: What Evidence We Have vs. What We Need

**Title:** Evidence So Far vs. Next Data Points

**Visual:**  
- Two-column table: "Already Have" vs. "Need to Test"

**Already Have:**
- Parish-level evidence of Radzimowski surname in Tczew County (1653-1934)
- Clear mapping of **northern vs. southern** surname clusters
- Archaeological and historical data on Ciepłe:
  - Elite, Danish-connected site
  - Same county as later Radzimowski families

**Need to Test:**
- **Y-DNA test** from at least one confirmed male-line Radzimowski descendant from Tczew County cluster
- **Ciepłe aDNA data** (Y-DNA haplogroups and SNP-level data) when published
- Phylogenetic comparison between:
  - Northern Radzimowski Y-DNA
  - Existing I-Y45113 tree
  - Any Ciepłe Y-DNA individuals

**Speaker Notes (60 sec):**  
"Right now, the northern hypothesis rests on **geography**, **surname distribution**, and **archaeological context**. That's enough to make it worth testing, but not nearly enough to call it proven. What we need next is straightforward: one or more Y-DNA tests from northern Radzimowski descendants, and the publication of Ciepłe's ancient DNA. Only then can we overlay these data on the Y-tree and see whether the lines intersect or not."

## Slide 9: Possible Outcomes

**Title:** If the Hypothesis Is Confirmed… or Refuted

**Visual:**  
- Split slide: "If Confirmed" vs. "If Refuted"

**If Confirmed:**
- Northern Radzimowski cluster = **third geographic branch** of I-Y45113
- Strong support for a **Ciepłe-linked northern story**
- Dual-wing model (Bodzia-Rus', Ciepłe-Danish) gains real genetic backing
- Our family narrative gains a **north-coast chapter** anchored in Tczew County

**If Refuted:**
- Northern Radzimowski cluster = **independent surname line**
- Ciepłe connection is **ruled out for this surname**
- Still valuable: clarifies which Radzimowski families belong to our genetic line and which do not

**Speaker Notes (45-60 sec):**  
"Good science is about testable hypotheses. If this idea is confirmed, we gain a powerful new chapter in our story that ties the Radzimowski name to two major elite centers of the Piast age. If it's refuted, that's equally useful: we will know the northern Radzimowski families belong to a **different genetic story**, and we'll avoid over-interpreting geographical coincidences. Either way, the data will sharpen our understanding."

## Slide 10: Call to Action

**Title:** How to Move the Northern Hypothesis Forward

**Visual:**  
- Checklist overlaying the Tczew-Ciepłe map

**Action Items:**
1. **Identify male-line descendants** of Radzimowski families from Tczew County (using Geneteka, parish books, and living contacts).
2. **Sponsor Y-DNA testing** (preferably Big Y-700 or similar) for at least one northern descendant.
3. **Monitor Ciepłe publications** for ancient DNA results (expected in the next research wave).
4. **Prepare comparison framework**:
   - Place northern Radzimowski result on the I-Y45113 tree (or another tree if different)
   - Compare with any Ciepłe Y-DNA haplotypes when available.

**Speaker Notes (45-60 sec):**  
"To move from speculation to knowledge, we need two concrete things: a modern Y-DNA test from the northern cluster, and published Y-DNA data from Ciepłe. The rest is legwork—identifying the right descendants, helping with testing costs if needed, and carefully comparing results once they arrive. The northern hypothesis is a potential **new frontier** in our research. Now we have a clear, realistic plan to test it."

**Last Updated:** January 2026  
**Status:** Testable Hypothesis (pending Y-DNA test from northern cluster and Ciepłe aDNA publication)  
**Next Steps:** Identify northern Radzimowski descendants, sponsor Y-DNA testing, monitor Ciepłe aDNA publications
