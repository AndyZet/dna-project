# Analysis: Aleksei's Email Update (January 2026)
## Context: Review Against HYPOTHESIS_LIST.md and HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md

**Date:** January 2026  
**Source:** Email from Aleksei Berezhnoy to Andrzej and Artur  
**Status:** Critical updates requiring hypothesis revision

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Aleksei's email provides **one critical setback** (Doug Skory Big Y-700 not completed) and **several important confirmations** (Wladyslaw Y-STR distances, autosomal DNA absence, YFull age refinement (YTree branch dating update)). The email also introduces **new insights** about the potential relationship between Wladyslaw Mazgaj and Doug Skory that could reshape the phylogenetic model.

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 🔴 **SETBACK: Doug Skory Big Y-700 Still Not Completed**

**Aleksei's Statement:** *"Unfortunately, Skory did not order the BigY test yet. We need to contact him and his relatives again about it."*

**Impact on Hypotheses:**
- **H0.1 (Doug Skory Big Y-700 Confirmation)**: Status changes from "Unknown (pending contact)" → **"Not Completed (4-year delay)"**
  - Confidence: **50% → 25%** (higher abandonment risk after 4-year delay)
  - Priority: Remains 🔴 URGENT, but urgency increases due to time lapse
  - Action Required: Immediate re-contact with Judith/Doug; restart funding process

- **H3.4 (Skory Ukrainian Migration Branch)**: Confidence remains conditional (75% if Big Y confirms), but timeline extends
- **H5.3 (TMRCA (Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor) Calculation)**: Cannot include Doug as fifth comparator until Big Y completed

**Updated Timeline:**
- Original funding commitment: February 2022 ($239)
- Last contact: November 2022 (4 years ago)
- Current status: Test not ordered despite funding commitment
- Risk assessment: Higher likelihood of abandonment; requires renewed engagement

### ✅ **CONFIRMATION: Wladyslaw Mazgaj Y-STR Distances**

**Aleksei's Data:**
- **Aleksei ↔ Wladyslaw**: 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 mutations
- **Aleksei ↔ Doug Skory**: 2/25, 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 mutations

**Impact on Hypotheses:**
- **H1.4 (Wladyslaw Mazgaj Y-DNA Placement)**: Confidence **75% → 78%**
  - Y111 distance of 10/111 confirms cousin-level connection (consistent with I-Y45113)
  - Clean Y-STR data now available for TMRCA calculations (H5.3)
  - Terminal SNP (Terminal Hg: haplogroup branch with youngest estimated age) still unknown (needs YFull upload)

- **H1.1 (Patrilineal Y-DNA Connection)**: Confidence **70% → 73%**
  - Wladyslaw's Y111 distance validates four-way cluster hypothesis
  - Aleksei's prediction that "Wladyslaw will form a new young sub branch together with Artur" suggests I-Y224059 placement (needs verification)

**Key Insight:** The **identical Y111 distance (10/111)** for both Wladyslaw and Doug despite different intermediate marker patterns suggests:
- They are NOT siblings (different Y37/Y67 patterns)
- They likely represent cousin-level divergence within I-Y45113
- One may be I-Y224059 (with Artur) and one I-Y45233 (with Aleksei), OR both could be under I-Y224059 forming a sub-cluster

---

### ✅ **NEW INSIGHT: Wladyslaw ↔ Doug Skory Relationship Potential**

**Aleksei's Statement:** *"So Mazgay and Skory can be very close to each other if their mutations are the same."*

**Analysis:**
- Aleksei is suggesting direct haplotype comparison between Wladyslaw and Doug
- If their mutations align, they could be closer to each other than either is to Aleksei
- This would support a **three-branch model**:
  1. **Branch A**: Andrzej + Artur (I-Y224059, ~700 ybp (years before present) TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor))
  2. **Branch B**: Aleksei (I-Y45233, ~200 ybp TMRCA)
  3. **Branch C**: Wladyslaw + Doug (potential new sub-branch under I-Y224059 or I-Y45233)

**Hypothesis Impact:**
- **H1.1**: May need revision to accommodate three-branch structure
- **H5.3**: TMRCA calculations become more complex with potential sub-clustering
- **New Hypothesis Needed**: "H1.5: Wladyslaw-Doug Skory Sub-Branch Formation" (pending haplotype comparison)

---

### ✅ **CONFIRMATION: Autosomal DNA Absence**

**Aleksei's Statement:** *"Wladislaw Mazgay is not my Family Finder cousin."*

**Analysis:**
- Despite Y111 distance of 10/111 (patrilineal cousin-level), there is **no significant autosomal DNA sharing**
- Family Finder threshold is typically ~20 cM for 3rd cousins
- This indicates the common ancestor predates ~500 years (consistent with I-Y45113 TMRCA ~1050 ybp)

**Impact:**
- Supports careful distinction between **patrilineal** vs. **collateral genealogical** relationships
- Validates that Y-DNA connection is deep-lineage (pre-documentary era)
- Reinforces need for documentary research to bridge genetic and genealogical gaps

---

### ✅ **CONFIRMATION: YFull Age Refinement (YTree Branch Dating Update)**

**Aleksei's Statement:** *"I did not know that YFull decreased the age of our branch to 700 years."*

**Analysis:**
- Confirms I-Y224059 TMRCA ~700 ybp (approximately **1300-1350 CE**)
- This is **new information for Aleksei**, suggesting YFull tree was recently updated
- Worth checking YFull for new SNP/branch definitions or updated TMRCA calculations

**Impact:**
- **H5.3 (TMRCA Calculation)**: YFull branch dating now confirmed at ~700 ybp for I-Y224059
- Confidence in YFull estimates increases
- May indicate new SNP discoveries or refined mutation rate calculations

---

### ✅ **SUPPORTING EVIDENCE: Ukrainian Migration Pattern**

**Aleksei's Observations:**
1. *"Is Wladislaw a Polish name?"* - Linguistic awareness of Polish vs. Ukrainian naming
2. *"Last known Wladislaw's maternal ancestor is Anastasia Sheszcuk, first and last names of her are Ukrainian by origin."*
3. *"As you know, I can read Polish without asking google to translate unknown words."*

**Analysis:**
- Supports **H3.3 (Berezhnoy = Ukrainian Migration Branch)**
- Aleksei's fluent Polish suggests cultural continuity from Polish origins
- Wladyslaw's maternal Ukrainian ancestry (Sheszcuk) indicates mixed Polish-Ukrainian heritage, consistent with migration narrative
- Reinforces the Poland → Ukraine migration pattern documented in H3.3, H3.4, and H3.5

---

### ⚠️ **ACTION ITEM: Wladyslaw YFull Upload**

**Aleksei's Suggestion:** *"I suggest you to contact Wladislaw. The best way will be to ask him about a possibility to join YFull."*

**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Required Actions:**
1. Contact Wladyslaw Mazgaj (via Aleksei or directly if contact info available)
2. Request YFull upload or FTDNA Big Y kit number
3. Obtain terminal SNP placement (I-Y224059 vs I-Y45233 vs other)
4. Extract full Y-STR haplotype for comparison with Doug Skory

**Expected Outcome:**
- Confirms terminal SNP placement (H1.4)
- Enables haplotype comparison with Doug Skory (new H1.5)
- Refines TMRCA calculations (H5.3)

## NEW HYPOTHESIS PROPOSAL

### **H1.5: Wladyslaw-Doug Skory Sub-Branch Formation** (NEW)
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 40% (conditional on haplotype comparison)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Wladyslaw Mazgaj and Doug Skory form a distinct sub-branch within I-Y45113 (likely under I-Y224059), closer to each other than either is to Aleksei, suggesting a shared ancestor more recent than the I-Y45113 split (~1050 ybp) but older than the I-Y224059 formation (~700 ybp).

**Evidence Required:**
- Direct haplotype comparison between Wladyslaw and Doug
- Terminal SNP placement for both (YFull uploads)
- Confirmation that their mutations align (Aleksei's suggestion)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain full Y-STR haplotypes for both Wladyslaw and Doug
2. Compare marker-by-marker for alignment
3. Determine terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) placement (YFull)
4. Calculate pairwise TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) if sub-branch confirmed

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or refutes close relationship between Wladyslaw and Doug; refines phylogenetic model.

---

## DECISION TREE UPDATES

### **Wladyslaw Terminal SNP Outcomes:**
- **Wladyslaw = I-Y224059** → H1.1 confidence ↑; four-way cluster confirmed (Andrzej, Artur, Wladyslaw, Aleksei); proceed to STR/SNP TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor; H5.3)
- **Wladyslaw = I-Y45233** → Two-sister-branch model; integrate with Aleksei; revisit migration hypotheses (H3.3)
- **Wladyslaw ≠ I-Y45113** → Pivot to heraldic-only linkage; H7.1 risk increases; keep Artur/Aleksei/Andrzej cluster intact

### **Doug Skory Big Y Outcomes:**
- **Doug = I-Y224059** → If Wladyslaw also I-Y224059, test H1.5 (sub-branch formation); add as fifth comparator for TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor)
- **Doug = I-Y45233** → Two-branch model with Aleksei; revisit H3.4 migration timeline
- **Doug ≠ I-Y45113** → Treat as parallel branch; keep four-way cluster intact; H3.4 confidence decreases

### **Wladyslaw ↔ Doug Haplotype Comparison:**
- **Mutations align** → H1.5 confirmed; sub-branch formation; refine TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) calculations
- **Mutations diverge** → Independent branches; maintain current model; proceed with individual TMRCA calculations

| **YFull Age Confirmation** | Documented | **Confirmed by Aleksei** (~700 ybp) |
| **Core Comparators** | 4 (pending Doug) | **4 confirmed** (Doug excluded until Big Y) |
| **URGENT Actions** | 7 | **8** (add Wladyslaw YFull upload) |

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### **High Risk:**
- **Doug Skory Big Y abandonment**: 4-year delay increases likelihood of permanent non-completion
- **Mitigation**: Immediate re-contact; offer renewed funding; emphasize critical importance

### **Medium Risk:**
- **Wladyslaw terminal SNP unknown**: Blocks full phylogenetic placement
- **Mitigation**: Contact via Aleksei; request YFull upload; emphasize research value

### **Low Risk:**
- **YFull tree updates**: May have new SNP definitions requiring re-analysis
- **Mitigation**: Regular YFull monitoring; cross-check branch dating

---

## CONCLUSION

Aleksei's email provides **critical updates** that both advance and complicate the investigation:

**Advancements:**
- Clean Y-STR distance data for Wladyslaw and Doug
- Confirmation of YFull age refinement (~700 ybp)
- Negative autosomal DNA evidence (informative for relationship depth)
- New insight about potential Wladyslaw-Doug sub-branch

**Setbacks:**
- Doug Skory Big Y-700 not completed (4-year delay)
- Wladyslaw terminal SNP still unknown
- TMRCA calculations blocked until both resolved

**Next Critical Steps:**
1. Re-contact Doug Skory (urgent)
2. Contact Wladyslaw for YFull upload (urgent)
3. Compare Wladyslaw-Doug haplotypes (new priority)
4. Verify YFull tree updates (high priority)

The investigation remains **on track** but requires **immediate action** on the two critical data points (Doug Big Y, Wladyslaw terminal SNP) before proceeding to full TMRCA calculations.
