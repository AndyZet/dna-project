## TIER 1: FOUNDATIONAL Y-DNA HYPOTHESES (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### **H1.1: Patrilineal Y-DNA Connection**
**Status:** Partially Supported (Andrzej + Artur I-Y224059; Aleksei I-Y45233; Wladyslaw reported Big Y cousin, terminal SNP pending)  
**Confidence:** 70%  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Andrzej Radzimowski and a documented Garboś line share I-Y224059; Aleksei Berezhnoy is I-Y45233 within the same parent branch I-Y45113. If Wladyslaw Mazgaj is also under I-Y45113, the shared patrilineal ancestor predates the split between I-Y224059 and I-Y45233.

**Evidence Present:**
- SNPs confirm Andrzej as I-Y224059.
- YFull SNP matches show YF089989 (I-Y224059; Artur Garboś; MDA Józef Garboś b. 1710, Poland).
- YFull SNP matches show YF003943/YF108111 as I-Y45233 (Ukraine).
- YFull STR matches include close matches to YF089989 (7/462) and YF003943 (15/431).
- Aleksei reports Wladyslaw Mazgaj as a Big Y cousin; Y111 distance 10 from Aleksei; earliest known paternal ancestor Franciszek Mazgaj b. 1779, Poland.

**Evidence Required:**
- Terminal SNP/kit/YFull link for Wladyslaw Mazgaj; raw STR/SNP data if available
- Optional: raw SNP/STR data for Aleksei for independent verification

**Verification Steps:**
1. Anchor Andrzej's haplogroup using SNP and YFull matches (I-Y224059)
2. Record YF089989 as Artur Garboś's YFull kit; add documentation if needed
3. Obtain Wladyslaw's terminal SNP/kit (and upload to YFull if possible); place him on the I-Y45113 tree
4. Use YFull TMRCA plus comparable STRs for refined MRCA dating (including Wladyslaw if data allows)

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms whether all four sit under I-Y45113 and identifies which sub-branches connect directly (I-Y224059 vs I-Y45233). If Wladyslaw is I-Y45113, confidence increases; if not, this becomes a two-branch model.

### **H1.2: Kievan Rus' Origins**
**Status:** Speculative  
**Confidence:** 25%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** The I-Y45113 lineage may have a medieval East Slavic (Kievan Rus') geographic affinity. Autosomal affinity signals exist in MTA results, but they do not demonstrate direct descent or elite status.

**Evidence Required:**
- Independent, high-resolution autosomal or Y-DNA evidence linking the lineage to specific Rus' samples
- Published ancient DNA with clear Y-DNA placement relative to I-Y45113 sub-branches
- Geographic distribution analysis of I-Y45113 with primary or peer-reviewed sources

**Verification Steps:**
1. Treat MyTrueAncestry matches as exploratory signals only
2. Seek SNP-based aDNA comparisons with defined coverage/quality
3. Correlate lineage distribution with historical records and migrations

**Expected Outcome:** At best, a supported regional affinity; not proof of elite ancestry without stronger evidence.

### **H1.3: Bodzia Cemetery Connection**
**Status:** Speculative  
**Confidence:** 20%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** There may be a population-level affinity between the lineage and Bodzia cemetery individuals, but current evidence does not show direct descent.

**Evidence Required:**
- aDNA Y-DNA data from Bodzia samples with sub-branch resolution relative to I-Y45113
- Robust autosomal segment comparisons (not small-SNP-count matches)
- Independent archaeological or documentary correlation

**Verification Steps:**
1. Use MyTrueAncestry only as a lead, not as confirmation
2. Confirm Y-haplogroup placement of Bodzia samples and whether any fall within or near I-Y45113
3. Compare autosomal segments with reliable coverage thresholds

**Expected Outcome:** Possible regional/period affinity; direct line-of-descent requires stronger genetic evidence.

---

**Hypothesis:** The northern Pomeranian Radzimowski cluster (H3.7) may share deep ancestry with early medieval elites associated with the Ciepłe cemetery (late 10th–early 11th century), but confirmation requires ancient DNA.

**Evidence Present (Verified Archaeology):**
- UW archaeology project describes the Ciepłe settlement complex (Tczew County) as late 10th/early 11th century and tied to early Piast expansion and Vistula trade routes.
- Antiquity reports richly furnished chamber graves at Ciepłe indicating elite status; strontium suggests both local and western Scandinavian origins.
- Gdańsk Archaeological Museum project notes elite burials and ongoing analyses, with cultural traits linked to Scandinavian, Rus’, and Slavic traditions.

**Evidence Required:**
- Published aDNA/Y‑DNA haplogroup data from Ciepłe (if available)
- Confirmed Y‑DNA from the northern Radzimowski cluster (H3.7)
- Comparative analysis between I‑Y45113 and any Ciepłe/Bodzia Y‑DNA profiles

**Verification Steps:**
1. Review publications from the Ciepłe project for aDNA results
2. Contact the Ciepłe research team about Y‑DNA availability/comparison
3. Test living male-line descendants from the northern cluster (H3.7)
4. Compare Y‑DNA with any published Ciepłe/Bodzia haplogroups

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or refutes a deep-time link between the northern Radzimowski cluster and early medieval elites.

**Outreach Note (Draft, Ciepłe Project Team):**
Subject: Inquiry on Ciepłe aDNA/Y‑DNA results for comparative genealogy  
Hello Dr. Wadyl / Ciepłe Project Team,  
I’m conducting a genealogical study of a Radzimowski male line documented in the Gniew/Piaseczno area (17th–20th c.). We have Y‑DNA results (I‑Y45113) and are exploring whether any published or unpublished aDNA/Y‑DNA data from the Ciepłe cemetery might be suitable for comparison.  
Could you advise whether Y‑DNA haplogroups or BAM/VCF-level data are available (or planned) for the Ciepłe burials, and if external comparison is possible?  
Thank you for your time, and I’m happy to share our summary and consented Y‑DNA details if helpful.  
Best regards,

**aDNA/Y‑DNA Comparison Checklist:**
1. Confirm Ciepłe sample list and accession IDs in publications  
2. Determine if Y‑DNA haplogroups are reported; request if not published  
3. Ensure modern Y‑DNA test type and coverage (Big Y/YFull) are documented  
4. Normalize terminology (Y‑SNP nomenclature and build version)  
5. Compare haplogroup placement on a common tree (YFull/FTDNA)  
6. Record uncertainty (coverage, contamination, sample quality)  
7. Document permissions and ethical constraints for any data use

## TIER 6: SPECIALIZED RESEARCH HYPOTHESES

### **H6.1: Ukrainian Radzymowski Connection**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 30%  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Hypothesis:** Ukrainian Radzymowski families (Radzymovskyi spelling) may be patrilineal cousins of the Polish branch, but no Y-DNA evidence is available here.

**Evidence Required:**
- Y-DNA testing of Ukrainian Radzymowski male-line descendants
- Family trees showing Ukrainian branch
- Historical records of migration patterns

**Verification Steps:**
1. Contact Ukrainian Radzymowski descendants
2. Request Y-DNA testing from male-line relatives
3. Compare Y-DNA with Polish Radzimowski
4. Calculate TMRCA between branches

**Expected Outcome:** Documents two-branch structure (Polish vs. Ukrainian).

---

### **H6.2: Linguistic Etymology Analysis**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 30%  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Hypothesis:** Surname etymologies may reflect place-name or occupational origins, but this requires independent linguistic and historical evidence.

**Evidence Required:**
- Place name research
- Historical linguistic analysis
- Early surname usage patterns

**Verification Steps:**
1. Research place names matching surnames
2. Analyze linguistic roots
3. Check early surname variations
4. Compare with historical naming patterns

**Expected Outcome:** Clarifies surname origins.

## TIER 7: NEGATIVE CONTROL HYPOTHESES (To Rule Out)

### **H7.1: Two Unrelated Radzimowski Lineages**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** Unknown (no data)  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Hypothesis:** Andrzej's Radzimowski lineage and the Podkarpackie Radzimowski families represent two separate lineages with different Y-DNA, connected only through heraldic clan membership.

**Evidence Required:**
- Different Y-DNA haplogroups
- No autosomal DNA matches
- Separate geographic origins

**Verification Steps:**
1. Compare Y-DNA haplogroups
2. Check autosomal DNA matches
3. Analyze geographic distribution

**Expected Outcome:** If confirmed, rules out patrilineal connection.

---

### **H7.2: Berezhnoy Not Connected**
**Status:** Disfavored (YFull confirms Aleksei I-Y45233 under I-Y45113)  
**Confidence:** 10%  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Hypothesis:** Aleksei Berezhnoy's Y-DNA lineage is not related to the Polish Radzimowski-Garboś-Mazgaj cluster.

**Evidence Required:**
- Different Y-DNA haplogroup
- No shared autosomal DNA
- Different migration patterns

**Verification Steps:**
1. Compare family histories
2. Analyze geographic origins
3. Check autosomal DNA matches

**Expected Outcome:** If confirmed, rules out connection.

## DECISION TREE (Y-DNA OUTCOMES)

- **Wladyslaw = I-Y224059** → H1.1 confidence ↑; four-way cluster confirmed under I-Y45113 with Andrzej/Artur. Proceed to STR/SNP TMRCA (H5.3).
- **Wladyslaw = I-Y45233** → Two-sister-branch model; integrate with Aleksei; revisit migration hypotheses (H3.3).
- **Wladyslaw ≠ I-Y45113** → Pivot to heraldic-only linkage; H7.1 risk increases; keep Artur/Aleksei/Andrzej cluster intact.
- **Doug Skory Big Y (if available)** → Place on I-Y45113 tree; if I-Y224059 or I-Y45233, add as fifth modern comparator for TMRCA; if different, treat as parallel branch for Ukraine/USA migration.

## KEY METRICS

- **Total Hypotheses:** 28
- **High Confidence (70%+):** 4 confirmed (H0.2, H1.1, H1.4, H5.5) + 2 conditional (H3.4, H3.5)
- **Critical Priority (🔴 URGENT):** 7 (Doug confirmation, Casimir priest link, Casimir family link, Y-DNA connection, Wladyslaw placement, Skory migration branch, TMRCA)
- **Estimated Research Time:** 3-6 months core; 4-8 months with Skory integration
- **Potential Outcome:** A validated patrilineal linkage with defensible dating; historical attribution only if independently supported

## NOTES

- Current SNP/STR evidence covers Andrzej (I-Y224059); Aleksei is placed at I-Y45233 via YFull matches, but no raw SNP/STR file is present here for him.
- YFull tree data provided by the user indicates: I-Y45113 formed ~3800 ybp (TMRCA ~1050 ybp), I-Y224059 formed ~1050 ybp (TMRCA ~700 ybp), I-Y45233 formed ~1050 ybp (TMRCA ~200 ybp).
- `data/raw/y_dna_results/STR_statistic_for_YF079056.csv` flags private mutations (DYS608, DYS562, DYS389II, DYS471, DYS576) and branch-level STR stats for I-Y224059 and I-Y45113.
- `data/raw/y_dna_results/YFull _ STR matches3.pdf` is a longer distant-match list with diverse terminal haplogroups; it adds breadth but not direct lineage proof.
- Autosomal ancient DNA matching at low SNP counts should be treated as exploratory signals, not proof of direct descent.
- Confidence levels are provisional and should be updated only with verifiable genetic or archival evidence.
- Negative control hypotheses help rule out alternative explanations.
- Core Y-DNA comparator set: Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw; Doug becomes a fifth comparator if H0.1 is confirmed.
- Skory integration (contact strategy, Big Y status, migration branch) is documented in `docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md`; refer there for details and outreach steps.
