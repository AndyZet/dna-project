## SURNAME ETYMOLOGY & HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Radzymin → Radzimowski → Радзимовський Origin Chain

The Radzimowski surname derives from the Polish town of **Radzymin** (near Warsaw), chartered in 1475. The transformation follows standard Polish-Ukrainian linguistic patterns:

**1. Polish Formation (1475-1500s)**
- Noble families living near Radzymin adopted the surname **Radzimowski** ("of/from Radzymin")
- The **-ski suffix** indicates "of or from a place" — a common Polish nobility naming pattern
- First documented usage: Radzimowic, Płock region, 1552 (see H2.1)

**2. Ukrainian Adoption (1500s-1700s)**
- During the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Polish families settled in Ukrainian territories
- Ukrainian speakers retained the surname but adapted to Cyrillic orthography:
  - Polish **-ski** → Ukrainian **-ський**
  - **Radzimowski** → **Радзимовський**
- This is a **script/alphabet change**, not a semantic translation — the surname meaning is identical

**3. Geographic Split (1795 Partitions)**
After Poland's partitions (1772-1795):
- **Polish territories** → Prussian/Austrian/Russian control → surnames often Germanized or Russified
- **Ukrainian territories** → Russian Empire → Ukrainian surnames preserved in Cyrillic
- **Result:** ~185+ Радзимовськs documented in Ukraine; significantly fewer Radzimowskis remain in Poland

### Implications for Research

This etymology establishes that Polish Radzimowski and Ukrainian Радзимовський are **orthographic variants of the same surname**, not separate family names. If male-line descendants of both branches share I-Y45113:
- Confirms **patrilineal continuity** across the Polish-Ukrainian linguistic boundary
- Suggests migration or settlement during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth era (1569-1795)
- Does NOT definitively establish migration direction — the lineage may have been present in both regions since medieval times (see H3.3 alternative interpretations)

## TIER 0: URGENT PRE-VERIFICATION (SKORY INTEGRATION)

### **H0.1: Doug Skory Big Y-700 Confirmation**
**Status:** Not Completed (4-year delay; Aleksei confirms test not ordered as of January 2026)  
**Confidence:** 25% (down from 50%; higher abandonment risk after 4-year delay)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Doug Skory's Big Y-700 test was completed and places him under I-Y45113 (likely I-Y224059 or I-Y45233), adding a fifth modern comparator to the core Y-DNA set.

**Update (January 2026):** Aleksei confirms: "Unfortunately, Skory did not order the BigY test yet. We need to contact him and his relatives again about it." Despite funding commitment from February 2022 ($239), test remains uncompleted after 4-year delay. Immediate re-contact required.

**Evidence Required:**
- Confirmation of Big Y-700 completion
- FTDNA kit number or YFull link (YFxxxxx kit identifier, if available)
- Raw SNP data (optional but preferred)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Contact Judith/Doug to confirm Big Y-700 status
2. Obtain kit number and access to results
3. Upload to YFull if not already done
4. Add Doug to TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) analysis (H5.3) once data is available

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or rules out Doug as a fifth comparator under I-Y45113.

### **H0.2: Casimir Skory Priest Connection (Grand Rapids)**
**Status:** Supported (user-provided images + published local history) — independent archival verification pending  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Casimir Skory (Poland-born) served as pastor at St. Adalbert’s Church in Grand Rapids, and documentary records link him to Louis Skory at the church address (Fourth & Davis), establishing a concrete Skory anchor in the Grand Rapids Polish community.

**Evidence Present (User-Provided):**
- Michigan death certificate lists Casimir Skory as a pastor at St. Adalbert’s Church; birthplace Poland; informant Louis Skory; address Fourth & Davis.
- Newspaper clipping (La Patrie, Montreal, 1910) names Rev. Casimir Skory as celebrant for Stanley Ketchel’s funeral in Grand Rapids.
- History Grand Rapids Historical Commission photo essay “A Tale of Two Cities: Trzemeszno & Grand Rapids” (Maciej Adamski & Diana Barrett, Nov 23, 2010) describes Fr. Casimir Skory arriving in Grand Rapids in 1894, prior immigration to Bay City with his mother/stepfather Michael Kowalski (1875), and his death in March 1935. (Content from user-provided excerpt; independent verification pending.)

**Discrepancy Notes:**
- Birth year and death date conflict across sources (death certificate shows 1884 birth / 1925 death; local history states arrival 1894 and death March 1935). Possible misread, transcription error, or multiple individuals.

**Evidence Required:**
- Certified death certificate copy to resolve date discrepancy
- Independent access to the History Grand Rapids photo essay for full citation
- Parish/archdiocese records confirming tenure and family ties
- Identification of Louis Skory relationship (nephew/relative) via census or city directories

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain certified death certificate and reconcile 1925 vs 1935 dates
2. Capture full citation and archival copy of the History Grand Rapids photo essay
3. Request St. Adalbert/archdiocese personnel records for Casimir Skory (ordination, assignments)
4. Locate Louis Skory in Grand Rapids records (1900-1930) and confirm relationship

**Expected Outcome:** Establishes a documented Grand Rapids Skory anchor and clarifies the Casimir/Louis connection.

---

### **H0.3: Fr. Casimir Skory Family Link to Doug’s Skory Line**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 55%  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Fr. Casimir Skory (Trzemeszno → Grand Rapids) is a close relative (brother/cousin/uncle) of Anthony/Casimer Skory in Doug’s lineage, providing a direct documentary bridge from Trzemeszno to the Grand Rapids/Traverse City Skory line.

**Evidence Present (User-Provided):**
- Fr. Casimir Skory and Doug’s known Skory ancestors both trace to Trzemeszno.
- John R. Skory was born in Grand Rapids in 1895 during Fr. Casimir’s pastorate.
- The Casimir/Louis Skory records point to a Skory family presence at St. Adalbert’s during the relevant period.

**Evidence Required:**
- Trzemeszno parish registers linking Casimir/Anthony/Casimer Skory lines
- St. Adalbert baptism/marriage records for Anthony Skory or his children
- City directories/census records establishing family relationships (Skory/Kowalski households)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Search Trzemeszno parish registers for Skory family clusters (1850-1885)
2. Query St. Adalbert baptism/marriage records for Anthony/John R. Skory
3. Cross-check Grand Rapids city directories and census records for kinship ties

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or refutes the close familial relationship between Fr. Casimir Skory and Doug’s Skory line.

## TIER 1: FOUNDATIONAL Y-DNA HYPOTHESES (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### **H1.1: Patrilineal Y-DNA Connection**
**Status:** Partially Supported (Andrzej + Artur I-Y224059; Aleksei I-Y45233; Wladyslaw Y-STR confirmed, terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) pending)  
**Confidence:** 73% (up from 70%; Wladyslaw's confirmed Y-STR distances strengthen clustering)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Andrzej Radzimowski and a documented Garboś line share I-Y224059; Aleksei Berezhnoy is I-Y45233 within the same parent branch I-Y45113. If Wladyslaw Mazgaj is also under I-Y45113, the shared patrilineal ancestor predates the split between I-Y224059 and I-Y45233.

**Evidence Present:**
- SNPs confirm Andrzej as I-Y224059.
- YFull SNP matches show YF089989 (I-Y224059; Artur Garboś; MDA Józef Garboś b. 1710, Poland).
- YFull SNP matches show YF003943/YF108111 as I-Y45233 (Ukraine).
- YFull STR matches include close matches to YF089989 (7/462) and YF003943 (15/431).
- Aleksei confirms Wladyslaw Mazgaj Y-STR distances: 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei (January 2026).
- Aleksei predicts: "It is very likely that Wladislaw will form a new young sub branch together with Artur" (suggests I-Y224059 placement).
- Aleksei notes identical Y111 distance (10/111) for both Wladyslaw and Doug Skory, suggesting potential sub-branch formation (see H1.5).

**Evidence Required:**
- Terminal SNP (Terminal Hg: haplogroup branch with youngest estimated age)/kit/YFull link (YFxxxxx kit identifier) for Wladyslaw Mazgaj; raw STR/SNP data if available
- Optional: raw SNP/STR data for Aleksei for independent verification

**Verification Steps:**
1. Anchor Andrzej's haplogroup using SNP and YFull matches (I-Y224059)
2. Record YF089989 as Artur Garboś's YFull kit; add documentation if needed
3. Obtain Wladyslaw's terminal SNP (Terminal Hg)/kit (and upload to YFull if possible); place him on the I-Y45113 tree
4. Use YFull TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) plus comparable STRs for refined MRCA dating (including Wladyslaw if data allows)

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms whether all four sit under I-Y45113 and identifies which sub-branches connect directly (I-Y224059 vs I-Y45233). If Wladyslaw is I-Y45113, confidence increases; if not, this becomes a two-branch model.

### **H1.2: Kievan Rus' Origins**
**Status:** Speculative  
**Confidence:** 25%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** The I-Y45113 lineage may have a medieval East Slavic (Kievan Rus') geographic affinity. Autosomal affinity signals exist in MTA results, but they do not demonstrate direct descent or elite status.

**Evidence Required:**
- Independent, high-resolution autosomal or Y-DNA evidence linking the lineage to specific Rus' samples
- Published ancient DNA with clear Y-DNA placement relative to I-Y45113 sub-branches
- Geographic distribution analysis of I-Y45113 with primary or peer-reviewed sources

**Verification Steps:**
1. Treat MyTrueAncestry matches as exploratory signals only
2. Seek SNP-based aDNA comparisons with defined coverage/quality
3. Correlate lineage distribution with historical records and migrations

**Expected Outcome:** At best, a supported regional affinity; not proof of elite ancestry without stronger evidence.

---

### **H1.3: Bodzia Cemetery Connection**
**Status:** Speculative (strengthened by RA series but not conclusive)
**Confidence:** 25% (up from 20%; MTA matches and tamga evidence support elite affinity, but see RA.6 caveats)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH
**Cross-reference:** See RA.1-RA.6 for detailed VK157 analysis; RA.5 for MTA matches; RA.6 for iconographic debate

**Hypothesis:** There may be a population-level affinity between the I-Y45113 lineage and Bodzia cemetery individuals (specifically VK157, I1-S2077), but current evidence does not show direct descent. VK157 is ancestral to I-Y45113, making a phylogenetic connection plausible.

**⚠️ January 2026 Update:**
The Bodzia connection is now supported by multiple lines of evidence (see RA.1-RA.6) but remains contested:

| Evidence Type | Supports Connection | Caveats |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| Y-DNA phylogeny | VK157 (I1-S2077) is ancestral to I-Y45113 | Deep ancestry (~4,000 ybp phylogenetic separation within I1), not recent kinship |
| MTA Deep Dive | VK157 matches de Warenne, Hastings (RA.5) | MTA matches are exploratory, not definitive |
| Tamga/belt strap-end | May indicate Rurikid elite status | Duczko 2018 revised interpretation (RA.6) |
| VK155-VK157 relationship | 122 cM shared, same mtDNA H1c (RA.3) | Supports VK157 elite status, not APR connection |

**Evidence Required:**
- aDNA Y-DNA data from Bodzia samples with sub-branch resolution relative to I-Y45113
- Robust autosomal segment comparisons (not small-SNP-count matches)
- Independent archaeological or documentary correlation

**Verification Steps:**
1. Use MyTrueAncestry only as a lead, not as confirmation
2. Confirm Y-haplogroup placement of Bodzia samples and whether any fall within or near I-Y45113
3. Compare autosomal segments with reliable coverage thresholds
4. Review RA.6 for updated tamga interpretation

**Expected Outcome:** Possible regional/period affinity; direct line-of-descent requires stronger genetic evidence. The strongest claim (APR lineage descends from Svyatopolk/VK157) remains speculative.

### **H1.4: Wladyslaw Mazgaj Y-DNA Placement**
**Status:** Partially Supported (Y-STR distances confirmed; terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) pending)  
**Confidence:** 78% (up from 75%; clean Y-STR data confirms cousin-level connection)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Wladyslaw Mazgaj is within I-Y45113 (likely I-Y224059 or I-Y45233), consistent with the Radzimowski-Garboś-Berezhnoy cluster.

**Evidence Present (January 2026 Update):**
- Aleksei confirms Y-STR distances: 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 mutations from Aleksei
- Y111 distance of 10/111 confirms cousin-level connection (consistent with I-Y45113)
- Aleksei notes: "Wladislaw Mazgay is not my Family Finder cousin" (no autosomal DNA sharing, consistent with deep-lineage patrilineal connection)

**Evidence Required:**
- Wladyslaw's terminal SNP (Terminal Hg)/kit/YFull link (YFxxxxx kit identifier; Aleksei suggests contacting Wladyslaw to join YFull)
- Full Y-STR haplotype for comparison with Doug Skory (Aleksei suggests: "Mazgay and Skory can be very close to each other if their mutations are the same")

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain Wladyslaw's terminal SNP (Terminal Hg)/kit (and YFull upload (BAM or VCF file) if possible)
2. Place his terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) on the I-Y45113 tree
3. Confirm Y111 haplotype; incorporate distance into TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) calculations (H5.3)
4. Update H1.1 confidence based on placement

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or rejects the four-way patrilineal hypothesis.

---

### **H1.5: Wladyslaw-Doug Skory Sub-Branch Formation** (NEW)
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 40% (conditional on haplotype comparison)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Wladyslaw Mazgaj and Doug Skory form a distinct sub-branch within I-Y45113 (likely under I-Y224059), closer to each other than either is to Aleksei, suggesting a shared ancestor more recent than the I-Y45113 split (~1050 ybp (years before present)) but older than the I-Y224059 formation (~700 ybp).

**Evidence Present (January 2026):**
- Aleksei notes identical Y111 distance (10/111) for both Wladyslaw and Doug from Aleksei
- Different intermediate marker patterns (Wladyslaw: 4/37, 6/67; Doug: 2/25, 4/37, 6/67) suggest they are NOT siblings but may be cousins
- Aleksei suggests: "So Mazgay and Skory can be very close to each other if their mutations are the same"
- Aleksei predicts: "It is very likely that Wladislaw will form a new young sub branch together with Artur"

**Evidence Required:**
- Direct haplotype comparison between Wladyslaw and Doug (full Y-STR panels)
- Terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) placement for both (YFull uploads (BAM or VCF files from Big Y tests))
- Confirmation that their mutations align (Aleksei's suggestion)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain full Y-STR haplotypes for both Wladyslaw and Doug
2. Compare marker-by-marker for alignment
3. Determine terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) placement for both (YFull uploads)
4. Calculate pairwise TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) if sub-branch confirmed
5. Compare with Artur's haplotype to test "new sub branch together with Artur" hypothesis

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or refutes close relationship between Wladyslaw and Doug; refines phylogenetic model; may identify new sub-branch under I-Y224059.

## RURIKID DYNASTY Y-DNA ANALYSIS (Ancient DNA Context)

### **RA.1: VK157-VK542 Y-DNA Mismatch — Rurikid Non-Paternity Event**
**Status:** Critical Observation — Requires Genealogical Revision
**Confidence:** 95% (Y-DNA haplogroups are definitive; identifications are hypothetical)
**⚠️ Note:** The NPE conclusion depends on VK157 = Svyatopolk identification, which is now contested (see RA.6 for tamga debate)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (impacts interpretation of VK157 = Svyatopolk hypothesis)
**Cross-reference:** See **RA.3** for VK155-VK157 Emnilda evidence that strengthens VK157 = Svyatopolk identification

**Observation:** Ancient DNA samples VK157 and VK542 have **incompatible Y-DNA haplogroups** despite both being attributed to the Rurikid dynasty context.

**⚠️ CRITICAL CLARIFICATION (January 2026):**

The identification of both samples requires careful distinction:

| Sample | Commonly Cited Identity | Alternate Identity | Y-DNA | Death Date |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| VK157 | Svyatopolk I (son of Yaropolk I) | Unknown Bodzia elite | **I1-S2077** | ~1019 CE |
| VK542 | **Gleb Svyatoslavich** (d. 1078) | NOT Gleb Vladimirovich (d. 1015) | **I2-Y4460** | 1078 CE |

**Important:** VK542 is identified in peer-reviewed Rurikid genetic studies as **Gleb Svyatoslavich** (d. 1078), the son of Svyatoslav II and great-great-grandson of Vladimir the Great — NOT as Gleb Vladimirovich (d. 1015), who was Vladimir's direct son. This changes the genealogical relationship but does NOT invalidate the NPE conclusion.

**The Problem:** I1 and I2 haplogroups diverged **~25,000+ years ago**. If both individuals are patrilineal descendants of Svyatoslav the Brave, they **must** share the same Y-DNA haplogroup. The mismatch proves at least one **non-paternity event (NPE)** occurred somewhere in the Rurikid line.

**Corrected Genealogical Context:**
```
                    Svyatoslav the Brave (942-972)
                               │

              │                             (d. 1076)
              │                                  │
              │                        Gleb Svyatoslavich
              │                         (VK542, d. 1078)
              │                            I2-Y4460
              │                                  │
              └────── 4 GENERATIONS GAP ─────────┘
                     Y-DNA MISMATCH STILL PROVES NPE
```

**Why the NPE conclusion remains valid:**
- Even with 4 generations between VK157 and VK542, Y-DNA should be identical if patrilineal continuity existed
- The I1 vs. I2 mismatch proves an NPE occurred **somewhere** in the Rurikid male line
- Most likely location: Vladimir's lineage (his mother Malusha was a slave/concubine)

**Historical Note:** According to the chronicle narrative (as depicted in the Russian TV series "The Rurik Dynasty"), Vladimir killed his brother Yaropolk and took Yaropolk's pregnant wife. The child born was Svyatopolk — so he was supposedly Yaropolk's biological son, not Vladimir's.

**⚠️ Identification Caveats:**

Both identifications remain **hypothetical**, not confirmed:

1. **VK157 = Svyatopolk I**: Supported by RA.3 (Emnilda/VK155) and RA.4 (Ottonian princess) evidence, but NOT definitively proven
2. **VK542 = Gleb Svyatoslavich**: Cited in Rurikid genetic studies and MyTrueAncestry, but requires independent verification

**Rurikid Y-DNA Complexity:**

Published Rurikid-context ancient DNA shows **multiple Y-haplogroups**:

| Sample/Individual | Y-Haplogroup | Context |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| VK157 (Bodzia) | I1-S2077 | Svyatopolk hypothesis |
| VK542 | I2-Y4460 | Gleb Svyatoslavich attribution |
| Prince Dmitry Alexandrovich | N1a1a1a1a1a1a7a | Rurikid (verified) |
| Other Rurikid-context samples | R1a, N1a, I2a | Various attributions |

This diversity suggests the "Rurikids" as a political dynasty need not map to a single Y-DNA haplogroup — whether due to sample identity uncertainty, non-paternity events, or sampling different branches.

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Svyatopolk was NOT Yaropolk's biological son**
   - Yaropolk's wife may have been pregnant by someone else
   - The I1-S2077 Y-DNA came from an unknown father
   - Vladimir's court may have claimed Yaropolk paternity for political reasons

2. **Vladimir was NOT Svyatoslav's biological son**
   - Vladimir's mother Malusha was a slave/concubine
   - Svyatoslav may not have been Vladimir's biological father
   - This would explain why Vladimir's descendants (Gleb = I2-Y4460) have different Y-DNA

3. **Yaropolk was NOT Svyatoslav's biological son**
   - NPE in the senior line
   - Less likely historically documented, but genetically possible

4. **VK157 is NOT Svyatopolk**
   - The identification is a hypothesis, not confirmed
   - VK157 may be another elite individual buried at Bodzia
   - The I1-S2077 lineage may represent a different family entirely

5. **Neither line carries "original Rurik" Y-DNA**
   - Both Yaropolk and Vladimir may have different biological fathers
   - The "Rurikid" dynasty was a political construct, not genetic continuity
   - Medieval royal successions often involved legitimization regardless of biological paternity

**Finnish Autosomal Affinity — Challenging the "Swedish Connection":**

The Nature 2020 paper "Population genomics of the Viking world" (PMID 32939067) shows VK157's autosomal DNA clusters with modern **Finnish** populations, not Swedish. Combined with:
- I1-S2077 has a strong **PR683 branch** with significant Finnish representation (FTDNA Y700 testing)
- The traditional narrative places Rurik's origin in **Sweden**

**Question:** Where is the Swedish connection in the genetic data? The "Varangian" origin of the Rurikids may have been Finnish/Baltic rather than Swedish.

**Implications for Project Research:**

This VK157-VK542 mismatch is directly relevant to the project because:
1. VK157 (I1-S2077) is **ancestral** to I-Y45113 (the APR/Andrzej haplogroup)
2. If VK157 is NOT Svyatopolk, the "Rurikid connection" hypothesis weakens
3. If VK157 IS Svyatopolk, it suggests an NPE in the Rurikid dynasty
4. Either way, the APR lineage's connection is to the **I1-S2077 population**, not necessarily to "Rurikid royalty"

**Evidence Sources:**
- VK157 haplogroup: FTDNA 2020, [haplotree.info I-S2077 map](https://haplotree.info/maps/ancient_dna/slideshow_samples.php?searchcolumn=Y_Haplotree_Variant&searchfor=I-S2077&ybp=500000,0)
- VK542 (Gleb) haplogroup: MyTrueAncestry listing as I2-Y4460
- Finnish autosomal affinity: Nature 2020, "Population genomics of the Viking world" (PMID 32939067)
- Genealogical context: Russian TV series "The Rurik Dynasty" Episode 2, timestamp 21:50 ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDlirAhgwzs))

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm VK542 Y-DNA haplogroup independently (seek primary publication data)
2. Review all published Rurikid-era ancient DNA for Y-DNA consistency
3. Document which historical Rurikid descendants have been Y-DNA tested
4. Compare VK157's Finnish autosomal affinity with Swedish Viking samples
5. Investigate whether other I1-S2077 ancient samples show Finnish vs. Swedish clustering

**Expected Outcome:** Either:
- Identifies which Rurikid line(s) experienced NPE(s)
- OR refutes the VK157 = Svyatopolk identification
- OR reveals that the Rurikid genetic legacy is more complex than dynastic records suggest

### **RA.2: VK157 Finnish vs. Swedish Autosomal Affinity**
**Status:** Supported by Published Research
**Confidence:** 80% (Nature 2020 paper)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** VK157's autosomal DNA shows closer affinity to modern **Finnish** populations than to Swedish populations, challenging the traditional narrative of Swedish Varangian origins for the Rurikid dynasty.

**Evidence Present:**
- Nature 2020 "Population genomics of the Viking world" (PMID 32939067) — VK157 clusters with Finnish populations
- I1-S2077 haplogroup has strong Finnish representation in the PR683 branch (FTDNA Y700 data)
- Bodzia cemetery (where VK157 was buried) is in Poland, not Sweden

**Implications:**
1. The "Varangian" origin story may need revision — Finnish/Baltic rather than Swedish?
2. VK157 may represent a Finnish/Baltic elite rather than Swedish royalty
3. The I-Y45113 → I-Y224059 lineage (APR/Andrzej) may have Finnish rather than Swedish deep ancestry

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain G25 coordinates for VK157 and compare with Swedish vs. Finnish reference populations
2. Analyze other Bodzia samples for Finnish vs. Swedish autosomal patterns
3. Compare VK157 with documented Swedish Viking-era samples from the Nature 2020 dataset
4. Review published literature on Finnish vs. Swedish genetic differentiation in the Viking era

**Expected Outcome:** Clarifies the geographic origin of VK157 and the broader I1-S2077 lineage.

### **RA.3: VK155-VK157 Autosomal Relationship — Emnilda of Lusatia Connection**
**Status:** Strongly Supported (January 2026 Facebook research)
**Confidence:** 85% (genetic data matches historical sources)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (strengthens VK157 = Svyatopolk identification)

**Discovery:** In-depth autosomal comparison between VK157 and VK155 (the female buried with him) reveals they are **close relatives**, consistent with historical sources describing Svyatopolk's wife as his half-aunt.

**Genetic Evidence:**

| Metric | VK157 ↔ VK155 | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Shared autosomal DNA | **122 cM** | 2nd cousins or closer |
| Shared mtDNA | **H1c** (both) | Common maternal ancestor |
| Burial context | Together in grave E864/I | Husband-wife burial |

**Historical Context — The Emnilda Connection:**

Historical sources suggest Svyatopolk's wife may have been his **half-aunt** through Emnilda of Lusatia:

```
                    Emnilda of Lusatia
                    (Piast princess)
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        │                  │                  │
   Daughter A         Daughter B          (other children)
   (→ married,       (= VK155, wife
    had children)     of Svyatopolk)
        │
   Svyatopolk's
     Mother
        │
   Svyatopolk
    (VK157)
```

**If Emnilda was both:**
- Svyatopolk's **maternal grandmother** (mother's mother), AND
- Svyatopolk's **mother-in-law** (wife's mother)

Then VK155 (the wife) would be Svyatopolk's mother's half-sister — his **half-aunt**.

**Why 122 cM is Consistent:**

| Relationship | Expected cM | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Half-aunt/nephew | 425-850 cM | Full theoretical range |
| 2nd cousins | 75-360 cM | Typical range |
| **Ancient DNA** | **Lower than expected** | Degradation, calling errors, fragment loss |

The 122 cM shared DNA is within the expected range for ancient DNA analysis of half-aunt/nephew or close cousin relationships, accounting for:
1. DNA degradation over ~1000 years
2. Sequencing coverage limitations
3. Segment fragmentation from damage
4. Potential endogamy effects in medieval royal families

**Corroborating Evidence:**

1. **Shared mtDNA H1c** — Confirms maternal line connection through Emnilda
2. **Burial together** — Consistent with husband-wife interpretation
3. **Elite burial at Bodzia (~1019 CE)** — Timing matches Svyatopolk's death
4. **Historical sources** — Document the half-aunt marriage specifically

**Impact on RA.1 (Y-DNA Mismatch):**

This evidence **strengthens** the NPE conclusion:

- **IF** VK157 is confirmed as Svyatopolk (RA.3 supports this), **THEN**:
- The Y-DNA mismatch with VK542/Gleb (I1-S2077 vs I2-Y4460) **must** reflect a non-paternity event
- Most likely in Vladimir's line (his mother Malusha was a slave/concubine)
- OR in Yaropolk's line (Svyatopolk was called "son of two fathers" by Vladimir's court)

**Evidence Sources:**
- Facebook group research (January 2026): VK157-VK155 autosomal comparison
- MTA Deep Dive analysis: VK157 → VK155: 41 SNP chains, 114.79 cM (earlier estimate)
- Updated comparison: 122 cM shared DNA (January 2026)
- Historical sources on Emnilda of Lusatia and Svyatopolk's marriage
- Project documentation: `docs/VK155_VK157_BURIAL_HYPOTHESIS.md`

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain primary publication data on VK155-VK157 autosomal comparison
2. Verify Emnilda genealogy in independent historical sources
3. Calculate expected cM ranges for half-aunt/nephew with ancient DNA degradation models
4. Cross-reference with other Bodzia samples for endogamy patterns
5. Seek independent confirmation of the 122 cM measurement

**Expected Outcome:**
- High confidence that VK157 = Svyatopolk I
- Confirms VK155 as his wife (and maternal relative through Emnilda)
- Strengthens the NPE conclusion in RA.1 — the Y-DNA mismatch with Gleb must reflect illegitimacy somewhere in the Rurikid line

---

### **RA.4: Ottonian Princess Theory — Svyatopolk's Mother's True Identity**
**Status:** Supported by Medieval Source (Genealogia Welforum 1125/26)
**Confidence:** 65% (down from 70%; RA.6 tamga debate affects overall VK157=Svyatopolk chain)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (impacts interpretation of VK157 genetic affinities and legitimacy claims)
**Cross-reference:** Strengthens RA.1 (NPE), RA.2 (Western autosomal affinity), RA.3 (Emnilda connection); **see RA.6 for tamga debate affecting VK157 identification**

**Hypothesis:** Svyatopolk I's mother was NOT a "Greek nun" (as claimed by Yaroslav the Wise's court), but rather an **Ottonian princess** — the unnamed third daughter of Conrad (Kuno), Count of Swabia, and granddaughter of **Emperor Otto I**. This explains the strong Western European genetic affinities of VK157 and VK155.

**Primary Documentary Evidence — Genealogia Welforum (1125/26):**

The medieval genealogy *Genealogia Welforum* (with additions from *Historia Welforum* 1167/74) documents the family of Kuno and Richlint "von Öhningen" (Stammtafel 1, based on Reichenau Memorial records, 2nd half 10th century):

```
                    OTTO I, EMPEROR (912-973)
                           │
                     (Richlint) = [7] Richlint
                  "filia Ottonis Magni imperatoris"
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           │               │               │
    Conrad (Kuno)     Other children    Other branches
    Count of Swabia
           │
    ┌──────┼──────┬─────────┬───────────┬────────────┐
    │      │      │         │           │            │
  Leopaldus  Liutoldus  Chuono   Ita       "tertia"     quarta
   = [4]     = [2]      = [3]   de Oningen  ∞ REGI    [Kunigunde]
 Herimannus Liutoldus Cuonradus = [5] Ita  RUGORUM   ∞ comiti
             laicus    laicus   ∞ Ruodolfus   [-]     de Andhese
                                               │
                                        "King of the Rus"
                                         = YAROPOLK I (?)
                                               │
                                        SVYATOPOLK I (VK157?)
```

**The Key Text:** *"tertia ∞ regi Rugorum"* — "the third [daughter] married the king of the Rugians/Rus"

**Interpretation of "Rugorum":**

| Interpretation | Meaning | Likelihood |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| **Rus** (Kievan Rus) | Prince/King of the Rus = Yaropolk I | **HIGH** — fits 10th c. political context |
| Rugi (Germanic tribe) | Archaic term, rarely used in 10th c. | LOW |
| Rügen (Baltic island) | Local rulers, less prominent | LOW |

**If "regi Rugorum" = Yaropolk I, then:**
- Svyatopolk's mother was a **granddaughter of Emperor Otto I**
- She was from the **Ottonian-Swabian** noble line
- This makes Svyatopolk of **imperial Germanic descent** on his maternal side

---

**The "Greek Nun" Propaganda — Yaroslav's Court Falsification:**

The narrative that Svyatopolk's mother was a "Greek nun captured by Svyatoslav" comes from sources sympathetic to **Yaroslav the Wise** (Vladimir's son), who had political motivations to delegitimize Svyatopolk:

| Claim | Source | Motivation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| "Greek nun" mother | Yaroslav's court chronicles | Delegitimize Svyatopolk |
| "Son of two fathers" | Vladimir's propaganda | Question Svyatopolk's paternity |
| "Svyatopolk the Accursed" | Yaroslav's hagiography | Vilify rival claimant |

**Why Yaroslav needed to delegitimize Svyatopolk:**
1. **Yaroslav descended from Malusha** — a slave/concubine, not a princess
2. **Svyatopolk was from the senior line** (Yaropolk → Svyatoslav → Rurik)
3. **If Svyatopolk's mother was Ottonian royalty**, his claim to the throne was **superior** to Yaroslav's
4. **Calling her a "Greek nun"** removes her noble status and legitimacy

**Propaganda Pattern:**
```
ACTUAL LINEAGE (per Genealogia Welforum):
Svyatopolk ← Yaropolk I ← Svyatoslav I ← Rurik
    ↑
 Mother = Ottonian princess (granddaughter of Otto I)

YAROSLAV'S PROPAGANDA VERSION:
Svyatopolk ← "son of two fathers" (legitimacy questioned)
    ↑
 Mother = "Greek nun" (no noble status)
```

---

**Genetic Corroboration — Western European Autosomal Affinity:**

If Svyatopolk's mother was an Ottonian princess, we would expect:

| Prediction | Evidence | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Western European maternal ancestry | VK157 + VK155 share mtDNA **H1c** | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| Close genetic relationship to Western nobility | VK157 shows non-Scandinavian autosomal clustering | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| VK155 (maternal relative) also Western-affiliated | VK155 shares 122 cM with VK157, same mtDNA | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| Elite burial with Western connections | Bodzia cemetery shows mixed Scandinavian/Western elite culture | ✅ CONFIRMED |

**Note on Finnish vs. Western Affinity (RA.2):**
The Nature 2020 paper reported VK157 clustering with "Finnish" populations. However:
- 10th-century population genetics were different from modern reference panels
- "Finnish" clustering may reflect Baltic/Northern European components present in both Finnish and Germanic populations
- The Ottonian hypothesis does not contradict Finnish affinity — it explains the **Western European** component

---

**The Bident Tamga Evidence — Senior Line Marker:**

Svyatopolk used the **bident (двузубец, two-pronged) tamga**, NOT the trident (трезубец):

| Tamga Type | Symbol | Line | Primary Users |
|------------|--------|------|---------------|
| **Bident** | ⚔ (two-pronged) | **Senior** (Yaropolk) | Svyatopolk I |
| **Trident** | 🔱 (three-pronged) | Junior (Vladimir) | Vladimir I, Yaroslav, descendants |

**Significance:**
- The bident was the **original Rurikid symbol** of the senior line
- Svyatopolk's use of the bident confirms his **legitimate descent from Yaropolk** (senior branch)
- Vladimir's line adopted the trident as their distinct marker
- This is **independent heraldic evidence** supporting Svyatopolk's legitimacy

**Source:** Beletsky S. V. (2009). "Еще раз о знаках Рюриковичей" (Once again about the signs of the Rurikids). *Proceedings of the State Hermitage*, Vol. XLIX, pp. 222-226.

---

**Integration with Other RA Hypotheses:**

| Hypothesis | How RA.4 Connects |
|------------|-------------------|
| **RA.1** (Y-DNA Mismatch) | If Svyatopolk's mother was Ottonian, this doesn't affect Y-DNA — the NPE remains in the MALE line (either Yaropolk or Vladimir was not Svyatoslav's biological son) |
| **RA.2** (Finnish/Western Affinity) | Ottonian maternal ancestry explains Western European autosomal components in VK157 |
| **RA.3** (Emnilda/VK155) | Emnilda of Lusatia may have been connected to the Ottonian-Piast network; VK155's Western mtDNA H1c fits this model |

---

**Evidence Sources:**
- *Genealogia Welforum* (1125/26) with additions from *Historia Welforum* (1167/74)
- Reichenau Memorial records (2nd half 10th century)
- Stammtafel 1: "Die Familie Kunos und Richlints 'von Öhningen'" (annotations by Armin Wolf)
- Beletsky S. V. (2009) on Rurikid tamgas
- LKP note (Sept. 4th, 2023): "Who really was the wife of Yaropolk Svyatoslavich G.D. of Kiev?"

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain full text of *Genealogia Welforum* passage on "regi Rugorum"
2. Cross-reference with other 10th-11th century sources mentioning Yaropolk's wife
3. Analyze whether "Rugorum" consistently refers to Rus in contemporary documents
4. Compare Ottonian princess timeline with Yaropolk I's marriage date
5. Verify Beletsky's tamga analysis with independent heraldic sources
6. Check if any Ottonian-era documents reference a marriage alliance with Kievan Rus

**Expected Outcome:**
- Strengthens VK157 = Svyatopolk identification through multiple independent lines of evidence
- Explains VK157's Western European genetic affinities
- Documents the propaganda campaign by Yaroslav's court
- Connects the genetic findings (RA.1-RA.3) to historical context
- Validates the bident tamga as evidence of senior-line legitimacy

### **RA.5: I-Z63 European Elite Network — Von Plotho, Warenne, Stanhope, Erzya Connections**
**Status:** Research Lead — Strengthened by MTA Evidence (January 2026)
**Confidence:** 55% (up from 45%; LKP's MTA Deep Dive matches add independent signal)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (potentially significant for understanding I1 elite dispersal in medieval Europe)
**Cross-reference:** Related to but distinct from I-S2077 lineage (both are I1 subclades)

**🆕 January 2026 Update — LKP MTA Deep Dive Matches to VK157:**

LKP (contributor, January 21, 2026) reports new MyTrueAncestry Deep Dive matches that connect VK157 (Bodzia) to Anglo-Norman elite lineages:

| Family | Y-DNA Haplogroup | Match Type | Notes |
|--------|------------------|------------|-------|
| **de Warenne** | **I1-S10360** | Y-DNA + autosomal | Anglo-Norman barons; earls of Surrey |
| **Hastings** | **I1-Y24790** | Y-SNP autosomal Deep Dive | Anglo-Norman noble family |

**Significance:**
- Both de Warenne and Hastings reportedly have **MTA matches with VK157**
- This suggests VK157 may share ancestry with Western European/Norman elite networks
- Supports interpretation of VK157 as connected to pan-European dynastic circles (not just Fennoscandian)

**Warenne Family Context (per Sharon Bennett Connolly, 2021):**
- William de Warenne I (d. 1088) was 4th richest man in post-Conquest England
- Possibly related to Duke William through Duchess Gunnor (great-grandmother of William the Conqueror)
- Family seat: Castle Acre, Norfolk (LKP visited ruins)
- If Beatrix (William de Warenne's mother) was Gunnor's niece, the Warennes were royal cousins

**⚠️ Methodological Caveats:**
- MTA matches are **exploratory**, not definitive genealogical proof
- Autosomal matches after ~1000 years are noise-prone without segment analysis
- Y-DNA "matches" require terminal SNP confirmation to determine actual relationship
- The de Warenne/Hastings samples used by MTA have not been independently verified

**Reference:** Sharon Bennett Connolly. "The Origins of the Warenne Family." 22/05/2021. https://historytheinterestingbits.com/2021/05/22/the-origins-of-the-warenne-family/

**Hypothesis:** Multiple European noble families (von Plotho of Brandenburg, Warenne, Stanhope) and modern Erzya/Mordwin populations share haplogroup **I-Z63** or closely related subclades, suggesting a common ancestor in the early medieval period (~800-1000 CE) and wide geographic dispersal of an elite male lineage.

**Background — I-Z63 in the I1 Phylogeny:**

```
I-M253 (I1)
    │
    ├── I-Z63 (major subclade)
    │      │
    │      ├── Various downstream branches
    │      │      │
    │      │      ├── Von Plotho (Brandenburg)?
    │      │      ├── Warenne (England)?
    │      │      ├── Stanhope (England)?
    │      │      └── Erzya/Mordwin (Volga region)?
    │      │
    │      └── (other branches)
    │
    └── I-S2077 (separate branch — VK157/APR lineage)
           │
           └── I-Y45113 → I-Y224059 (Andrzej Radzimowski)
```

**Note:** I-Z63 and I-S2077 are **distinct branches** under I1. They share a common ancestor thousands of years ago but are NOT the same lineage. This hypothesis tracks I-Z63 separately from the main APR research focus (I-S2077 → I-Y45113).

---

**Documented I-Z63 Connections:**

| Family/Group | Location | Time Period | I-Z63 Status | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **Von Plotho** | Brandenburg, Germany | Documented from ~946 CE | Confirmed I-Z63 | Genealogy traced to Otto II era; Hermann I von Plotho (12th c.) |
| **Warenne** | England (Surrey, Sussex) | Post-1066 Norman | Reported on I-Z63 branch | William de Warenne I (d. 1088); Westminster Abbey burials |
| **Stanhope** | England | Medieval-modern | Reported on I-Z63 branch | Baronial family; Westminster Abbey burials |
| **Erzya/Mordwin** | Volga region, Russia | Modern population | I-Z63 matches reported | ~12% I1 in some Erzya samples (FTDNA project data) |

---

**Von Plotho — Primary Case Study:**

The **Freiherren von Plotho** are a Brandenburg noble family with documented history from the 10th century:

**Historical Documentation:**
- First documented: ~946 CE (Brandenburg region)
- Continuous male-line genealogy claimed from Hermann I von Plotho (12th century)
- Family crypts reportedly intact (not destroyed during WWII/Soviet era)
- Extensive family documentation available

**Y-DNA Status:**
- At least one male-line von Plotho tested as **I-Z63** (confirmed)
- Reported to be on the same sub-branch as Warenne/Stanhope
- Individual has been "inactive" in genetic genealogy discussions since ~2007
- Reported Y-STR matches to:
  - Polish/Eastern European lineages
  - **Erzya/Mordwin** individuals (Finno-Ugric population)

**Potential Research Opportunity:**
- Von Plotho family crypts reportedly survive
- Testing ancestral remains could verify multi-generational patrilineal continuity
- Would provide exceptional data point: documented noble genealogy + ancient DNA + modern DNA

---

**Why Erzya/Mordwin Matches Are NOT "Contradictory":**

The presence of I-Z63 (or I1 subclades generally) in both:
1. Western European nobility (von Plotho, Warenne, Stanhope)
2. Volga-Uralic populations (Erzya/Mordwin)

...is **historically plausible**, not contradictory:

| Explanation | Mechanism | Timeframe |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Viking-era trade routes** | Varangian route: Scandinavia → Baltic → Volga → Caspian | 800-1100 CE |
| **Early medieval migrations** | Germanic/Scandinavian expansion eastward | 500-1000 CE |
| **Shared deep ancestry** | Common I1 ancestor before regional differentiation | 2000-4000 BP |
| **Elite network dispersal** | Marriage alliances, military service, colonization | 800-1200 CE |

**Erzya/Mordwin Y-DNA Context:**
- FTDNA Erzya-Moksha DNA Project reports ~12% I1 in some samples
- I1 presence in Volga-Uralic populations is documented, not anomalous
- Does NOT indicate "Soviet soldier" ancestry (common misunderstanding)

---

**The "Hiding Since 2007" Phenomenon:**

A von Plotho family member reportedly:
- Tested Y-DNA showing I-Z63
- Had STR matches to Polish lineages and Erzya/Mordwin individuals
- Became inactive in genetic genealogy discussions (~2007)
- Reportedly resistant to discussing Y-DNA results

**Possible reasons for reluctance:**
1. **Ethnic identity conflict** — Matches to "Mordwins" may conflict with Germanic self-image
2. **Paper genealogy concerns** — DNA results may complicate documented ancestry claims
3. **Privacy preference** — Aristocratic families often prefer discretion
4. **Misunderstanding** — May incorrectly interpret Erzya matches as "non-European" ancestry

**Outreach attempts:**
- Contact attempted through Marek Skarbek Kozietulski (unsuccessful)
- Further contact recommended through neutral genealogical channels

---

**Warenne and Stanhope — Westminster Abbey Connection:**

Both families have members buried in **Westminster Abbey**, indicating high status in English medieval/early modern society:

**Warenne (de Warenne / Warren):**
- Anglo-Norman family arriving with William the Conqueror (1066)
- William de Warenne I (c. 1020-1088) — companion of William the Conqueror
- Major landholders in Surrey, Sussex
- Male line extinct by 14th century
- Y-DNA reported as I-Z63 branch (requires verification)

**Stanhope:**
- English baronial family
- Multiple members buried in Westminster Abbey
- Potential genealogical connection to Warenne (through marriage or common ancestry)
- Y-DNA reported on same I-Z63 branch as Warenne (requires verification)

---

**Verification Requirements:**

To confirm the I-Z63 elite network hypothesis:

| Step | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Obtain terminal SNP for von Plotho individual | Needed |
| 2 | Verify Warenne/Stanhope Y-DNA with SNP testing | Needed |
| 3 | Place all on YFull/FTDNA tree with precise branching | Needed |
| 4 | Compare with Erzya/Mordwin I-Z63 samples | Needed |
| 5 | (Optional) Test von Plotho ancestral remains | Possible if crypts accessible |

**Key Questions:**
1. Are von Plotho, Warenne, and Stanhope on the **same** I-Z63 sub-branch?
2. What is the TMRCA between these families?
3. Do Erzya I-Z63 samples share the same downstream SNPs?
4. Can ancient DNA from von Plotho crypts verify patrilineal continuity?

---

**Evidence Sources:**
- Von Plotho family documentation (available)
- FTDNA Erzya-Moksha DNA Project (12% I1 in some samples)
- Westminster Abbey burial records (Warenne, Stanhope)
- Email correspondence mentioning Marek Skarbek Kozietulski outreach attempt
- [Wikipedia: Von Plotho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Plotho)
- [Wikipedia: House of Warenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Warenne)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Contact von Plotho individual through neutral channels for terminal SNP sharing
2. Identify Warenne/Stanhope descendants willing to test or share existing results
3. Request I-Z63 branch placement from FTDNA I1 project administrators
4. Compare terminal SNPs with Erzya/Mordwin I-Z63 samples in public databases
5. If successful: Document as example of medieval elite Y-DNA dispersal across Europe

**Expected Outcome:**
- If confirmed: Documents remarkable case of I-Z63 dispersal from Germany to England to Volga region
- Provides comparative context for understanding I1 subclade distributions in medieval elite networks
- May reveal connections between Central European and Eastern European noble families
- Does NOT directly affect the I-S2077 → I-Y45113 research (separate I1 branch) but provides broader context for I1 haplogroup history

### **RA.6: Bodzia Belt Strap-End Tamga — Iconographic Debate (Cross vs. Mjölnir)**
**Status:** Contested — Academic Revision Exists
**Confidence:** 50% for "Svyatopolk marker"; 30% for "senior Rurikid line" (down from implicit ~70%; Duczko 2018 revision undermines cross interpretation)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (directly impacts VK157 = Svyatopolk identification strength)
**Cross-reference:** RA.1 (NPE), RA.4 (Ottonian princess)

**The Controversy:**

The Bodzia E864/I (VK157) belt strap-end bears a symbol interpreted as a **bident (двузубец)** — potentially a Rurikid tamga. The critical question is: **what is the mark at the top of the bident's prong?**

| Interpretation | Symbol | Scholar | Implications |
|----------------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Cross** (крест) | ✝ | Duczko (early view), LKP | = Svyatopolk I (his coinage shows bident + cross) |
| **Thor's Hammer** (Mjölnir) | ⚒ | Duczko 2018 revision | = Scandinavian religious symbol, NOT Svyatopolk-specific |

**Duczko's 2018 Revision (Critical Academic Counter-Evidence):**

Wladyslaw Duczko published a focused article in *Archeologia Polski* (2018) where he **explicitly revised** his earlier interpretation:

> "I previously proposed the 'cross' as the basis for connecting the bident to Svyatopolk. I now retract that reading and identify the mark at the top of the prong as **Thor's hammer (Mjölnir)**, not a cross."

**Source:** Duczko, W. (2018). "Znak na końcówce pasa z grobu E864/I w Bodzi" [The sign on the strap-end from grave E864/I at Bodzia]. *Archeologia Polski*, Vol. 63. Available at: https://rcin.org.pl/Content/85634/WA308_91702_P320_Znak-na-koncowce_I.pdf

**Impact of Duczko's Revision:**
1. **Removes the cleanest bridge** from the Bodzia strap-end to Svyatopolk specifically
2. **Shifts interpretation** from "dynastic marker of a specific prince" to "elite Scandinavian religious insignia"
3. **Models methodological humility** — Duczko warns against "smoothing over internal doubts because a hypothesis conveniently fits a preferred dating or narrative"

**LKP's Counter-Argument (January 2026):**

LKP (contributor, 50+ years studying tamgas) argues that:

1. **Belt tamgas indicated elite status** in Sarmatian/Bosporan tradition — only members of the ruling family wore such markers
2. **No "ordinary mercenary"** would have been allowed to wear a belt with a Rurikid bident
3. **The mark resembles a cross more than Mjölnir** — craftsmen (leather workers) didn't produce high-fidelity reproductions
4. **Pskov 2007 parallel** — similar bident pendant with cross element found in a Varangian grave later desecrated (revenge context)

**Pskov 2007 Archaeological Parallel:**

LKP cites a 2007 Pskov find that he considers significant for VK157 interpretation:

| Feature | Pskov 2007 Find | Bodzia VK157 |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Object | Silver trapezoidal pendant | Bronze belt strap-end |
| Symbol | Bident with "key" element | Bident with disputed top mark |
| Context | Elite Varangian grave (10th c.) | Elite burial (early 11th c.) |
| Post-burial | Grave desecrated, skull crushed | Intact burial |

**Pskov interpretation (Russian archaeologists, 2008):**
- The pendant was "Vladimir's tamga" — bident with a "key" symbol (referencing his mother Malusha, a ключница/key-keeper)
- Reverse shows falcon with cross — attributed to Princess Olga
- Interpreted as an "ID" of a princely representative (administrative function)
- Grave desecration attributed to revenge during Vladimir-Yaropolk conflict

**Supporting Scholarly Context: Sarmatian Tamga Origins (Powichrowski 2020)**

LKP's 2020 article on the Polish "Nowina" coat of arms provides broader scholarly context for the tamga → heraldry transmission thesis:

| Key Point | Relevance to RA.6 |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Tamgas = elite status markers** | "Only members of the ruling family wore such markers" — Bosporan Kingdom evidence |
| **Documented transmission route** | Sarmatian → Khazar → Germanic (Vandals) → Slavic elites (12th-15th c.) |
| **Craftsman approximations** | "Craftsmen didn't produce high-fidelity reproductions" — explains stylistic variation |
| **~1000-year continuity** | Ossete tamgas (19th c.) nearly identical to Bosporan (1st-3rd c.) |

**Sources cited by Powichrowski:**
- Lebedynski I., 2011 — *Les Tamgas. Une « héraldique » de la steppe*
- Sulimirski T., 1970, 1979 — *The Sarmatians* and *Sarmaci*
- Yatsenko S.A., 2001, 2010 — Tamga signs of Iranian-speaking peoples
- Jabłonowski A., 1891 — First scholar to propose Eastern origins for Polish heraldry

**Note:** This does NOT directly resolve the cross vs. Mjölnir debate, but provides scholarly grounding for treating belt strap-end symbols as elite status markers with deep historical transmission from steppe cultures to medieval Slavic elites.

**Key Distinction: Affiliation vs. Identity**

Even if the Bodzia strap-end IS a Rurikid-coded bident, this does **NOT** automatically prove VK157 = Svyatopolk:

| Level | What Symbol Proves | What It Doesn't Prove |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Affiliation** | Connected to Rurikid power structure | NOT necessarily blood kin |
| **Credential** | Administrative role, delegated authority | NOT necessarily the prince himself |
| **Identity** | High status within Rurikid orbit | NOT which specific person |

**Historian's Assessment (per GPT-5 analysis, January 2026):**

> "The strongest claim — that the strap-end proves Svyatopolk (and potentially that VK157 IS Svyatopolk) — is **not currently defensible as stated**, because a major specialist has publicly revised the 'cross' interpretation and because affiliation/credential does not equal blood identity."

---

**Graded Hypothesis Framework:**

Given the iconographic debate, the VK157 identity question should be framed as graded hypotheses:

| Hypothesis | Description | Current Confidence |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **H-VK157-1** | Elite foreign retainer in Piast service with Rus/Varangian ties | 60% |
| **H-VK157-2** | High official closely attached to a Rurikid ruler (administrative token) | 50% |
| **H-VK157-3** | Member of Rurikid bloodline (but not necessarily Svyatopolk) | 35% |
| **H-VK157-4** | Svyatopolk I himself | 25% (down from implicit ~50%; Duczko revision) |

---

**Verification Steps:**

1. Obtain high-resolution images of the Bodzia strap-end symbol
2. Compare with authenticated Svyatopolk coinage (bident + cross)
3. Compare with authenticated Mjölnir pendants from Viking-era contexts
4. Review Duczko 2018 in full (Polish language)
5. Compile corpus of 10th-11th century bident representations for comparison
6. Assess whether the "cross" vs. "hammer" distinction is even determinable given craftsmanship quality

**Expected Outcome:**
- If cross interpretation is reinstated: Strengthens VK157 = Svyatopolk (H-VK157-4 confidence increases)
- If Mjölnir interpretation holds: VK157 remains elite Scandinavian, but NOT specifically identifiable as Svyatopolk
- The broader "elite status" interpretation (H-VK157-1 and H-VK157-2) remains supported regardless

---

### **H3.2: Podkarpackie Regional Cluster**
**Status:** Partially Supported
**Confidence:** 70% (up from 60%; Mazgaj location independently confirmed)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Radzimowski, Garboś, and Mazgaj families formed a geographic cluster in Podkarpackie (within ~45 km) during 1700-1850 CE, suggesting local social ties. This supports proximity, not direct kinship by itself.

**Evidence Present (January 2026 Update):**
- **Jadwiga Tolk confirmation:** Mazgaj family documented in Sokołów Małopolski, 1800-1850; connected to pottery craft (garncarstwo)
- Geographic locations: Baranów Sandomierski (Radzimowski), Jadachy (Garboś), **Sokołów Małopolski (Mazgaj — confirmed)**
- Jadwiga's genealogical research traces Mazgaj roots to early 19th century in this region

**Evidence Required:**
- Parish records showing intermarriages
- Shared godparents and witnesses
- Cadastral records showing adjacent land holdings
- Potter guild records from Sokołów Małopolski (may identify Mazgaj family members)

**Verification Steps:**
1. ~~Map all three families' locations (1700-1850)~~ — Mazgaj location confirmed
2. Search parish records for cross-marriages
3. Analyze godparent networks
4. Review Austrian cadastral records for land patterns
5. **NEW:** Search Sokołów Małopolski potter guild/craft records (1800-1850)

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms local network and social connections.

### **H3.3: Berezhnoy = Ukrainian Migration Branch**
**Status:** Pending Verification — **Narrative Questioned**
**Confidence:** 25% (down from 35%; Aleksei's Polish fluency is self-taught, NOT family-transmitted; removes key supporting evidence)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Aleksei Berezhnoy is confirmed I-Y45233 (YFull (YTree database); Ukrainian origin in matches), and his ancestors may include a Polish branch that migrated to Ukraine in the 19th century and adopted the Ukrainian surname "Berezhnoy." Documentary evidence is still required.

**⚠️ January 2026 Update — Narrative Complication:**
Ukrainian Wikipedia documents multiple notable Radzimovsky (Радзимовський) families in Ukraine who **retained the Radzimowski surname** rather than adopting Ukrainian names:
- Віталій Іванович Радзимовський (1905-1975) — engineer/scientist, Ukraine → USA
- Дмитро Олександрович Радзимовський (1903-1985) — hydrobiologist, Kyiv
- Радзимовський — court judge in Kyiv, 1917-1918
- Іоанн Радзимовський — protopriest, Zvenyhorodka, Cherkasy region
- Петро Едуардович Радзимовський — teacher, Romny, Poltava region
- Броніслав Казимирович Радзимовський — information security specialist, Odesa

**Implication:** If other Radzimowskys in Ukraine kept their surname for generations, why would Aleksei's ancestors have adopted "Berezhnoy"? This suggests:
1. The Berezhnoy line may have **always been separate** from Radzimowski within I-Y45113
2. The lineage may have been present in **both Poland and Ukraine** since medieval times
3. The "Poland → Ukraine migration" narrative may be **oversimplified**

**Evidence Present (Circumstantial):**
- ~~Aleksei notes: "As you know, I can read Polish without asking google to translate unknown words"~~ — **CORRECTION (January 2026):** Aleksei learned Polish by himself; his parents did NOT speak Polish. This is **NOT evidence of Polish family origins**.
- Wladyslaw's maternal ancestor "Anastasia Sheszcuk" has "Ukrainian by origin" names (Aleksei's observation)
- I-Y45113 matches are predominantly Polish (but see H6.1 for Ukrainian Radzimovsky testing opportunity)

**Evidence NO LONGER Supporting Migration:**
- Aleksei's Polish fluency — self-taught, not family transmission

**Alternative Interpretations:**
1. **Dual-Origin Model:** I-Y45113 spread across Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with branches in both Poland and Ukraine since medieval period
2. **Deeper Common Ancestor:** The Berezhnoy and Radzimowski lines diverged centuries earlier, not in the 19th century
3. **Continuous Ukrainian Presence:** Aleksei's line may have always been Ukrainian, never using "Radzimowski"

**Evidence Required:**
- Berezhnoy family history indicating Polish origins beyond YFull country labels (from YTree sample metadata)
- Migration records from Poland to Ukraine (1800-1900) — **if they exist**
- Ukrainian archival records showing surname adoption — **or evidence of continuous "Berezhnoy" usage**
- Autosomal DNA showing elevated Polish ancestry
- **Y-DNA testing of Ukrainian Radzimovsky male-line descendants** (see H6.1)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Interview Aleksei about family history and oral traditions — **does he consider his family always Ukrainian or migrants from Poland?**
2. Search Ukrainian archives for "Berezhnoy" first appearance in his family's village
3. Check for Polish-origin families with similar Y-DNA in Ukraine
4. Analyze autosomal DNA for Polish admixture
5. **Cross-reference with H6.1** — if Ukrainian Radzimovskys test as I-Y45113, the migration narrative requires revision

**Expected Outcome:** Either documents migration to Ukraine and surname change, **OR** reveals that the lineage was present in both regions since medieval times.

### **H3.4: Skory Second Ukrainian Migration Branch**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 75% (conditional on Big Y-700 confirmation)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Douglas Skory represents a distinct Poland → Ukraine → USA migration branch that is phylogenetically linked to the Radzimowski-Garboś-Mazgaj-Berezhnoy cluster under I-Y45113. This is the second documented Ukrainian migration branch (after Berezhnoy in H3.3), with potential Radzimowski collateral lines as a third pattern.

**Evidence Required:**
- Big Y-700 confirmation and haplogroup placement (H0.1)
- Documentary evidence for Trzemeszno → Ukraine → USA migration path

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm Big Y-700 status and haplogroup placement
2. Collect parish/immigration records (Trzemeszno, Ukraine, Ellis Island)
3. Add Doug’s SNP data to TMRCA calculations (H5.3)

**Expected Outcome:** Establishes a second documented Ukrainian migration branch (alongside Berezhnoy) and strengthens diaspora pattern evidence. Together with potential Radzimowski collateral lines, this supports H3.5 (Three Parallel Ukraine Migration Branches).

---

### **H3.5: Three Parallel Ukraine Migration Branches**
**Status:** Emerging Pattern  
**Confidence:** 70% (dependent on H3.4 confirmation)  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Berezhnoy, Skory, and potential Radzimowski collateral lines reflect parallel 19th-century Poland → Ukraine migration pathways within the I-Y45113 lineage.

**Evidence Required:**
- H3.3 and H3.4 confirmation
- Independent archival evidence for each branch

**Verification Steps:**
1. Complete H3.3 and H3.4 validation
2. Compare timelines and migration drivers (uprisings, colonization, economics)
3. Document shared patterns across branches

**Expected Outcome:** A coherent, multi-branch Ukraine migration model.

---

### **H3.6: Trzemeszno → Grand Rapids Settlement Link (Skory Context)**
**Status:** Partially Supported  
**Confidence:** 60%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Published community history indicates Trzemeszno was a major source of Polish emigrants to Grand Rapids (1855-1900), aligning with the Skory line’s reported Trzemeszno origin and Grand Rapids settlement.

**Evidence Present (Verified Geography + Historical Context):**
- Trzemeszno (town) is in Gniezno County, Greater Poland Voivodeship (west-central Poland), with coordinates ~52.567°N, 17.817°E.  
- Gmina Trzemeszno is ~64 km east of Poznań and ~16 km east of Gniezno.  
- Official municipal history notes Trzemeszno was under Prussian partition in 1793–1918 (zabór pruski), consistent with the emigration‑pressure narrative.

**Evidence Present (User-Provided; Not Yet Verified):**
- History Grand Rapids Historical Commission photo essay “A Tale of Two Cities: Trzemeszno & Grand Rapids” (Maciej Adamski & Diana Barrett, Nov 23, 2010) describes Trzemeszno migrants to Grand Rapids, early settlers from the town, and St. Adalbert’s parish as a key institutional anchor. (Independent verification pending.)

**Evidence Required:**
- Independent access to the History Grand Rapids photo essay for full citation
- Confirmation via primary sources (Grand Rapids Public Library microfilm; parish archives)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Capture full citation for the History Grand Rapids photo essay
2. Search Grand Rapids Public Library microfilm for “Echo” newspaper references to Skory (1900-1920)
3. Request St. Adalbert parish records for Skory baptisms/marriages/burials (1880-1920)

**Expected Outcome:** Documentary support for the Trzemeszno → Grand Rapids link and better context for Skory migration timing.

### **H3.7: Northern Pomeranian Radzimowski Cluster (Tczew/Kociewie)**
**Status:** Partially Supported  
**Confidence:** 55%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** A distinct Radzimowski cluster exists in northern Poland (Pomeranian Voivodeship, Tczew County area), separate from the Podkarpackie cluster and potentially reflecting an independent lineage or an earlier regional branch.

**Evidence Present (Verified Geography):**
- Piaseczno is a village in Gmina Gniew, Tczew County, Pomeranian Voivodeship.  
- Gmina Gniew lies in Tczew County and Pomeranian Voivodeship (official municipal data).  
- Gmina Morzeszczyn (Pomeranian Voivodeship) includes sołectwa Dzierżążno and Nowa Cerkiew (official municipal data).

**Evidence Present (User-Provided Screenshots; Verification Pending):**
- Geneteka search results for region “pomorskie” with surname Radzimowski show entries across Piaseczno, Gniew, Dzierżążno, Nowa Cerkiew, Sztum, Pelplin, Wielki Garc, and Wielkie Walichnowy (1653–1934).

**Evidence Required:**
- Direct verification of Geneteka entries via links/exports (screenshots captured)
- Parish register copies from Pelplin Diocese for the listed localities
- Any documented link between the northern cluster and Podkarpackie/Trzemeszno lines

**Verification Steps:**
1. Export Geneteka entries for Radzimowski in Tczew County area (Piaseczno, Gniew, Dzierżążno, Nowa Cerkiew)
2. Pull parish register scans for earliest occurrences (Pelplin Diocese archives)
3. Map earliest Radzimowski households and identify recurring parents/witnesses
4. Seek Y-DNA test from a confirmed male-line descendant of the northern cluster

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms whether the northern Pomeranian cluster is independent or connected to the Podkarpackie/Skory lines.

## TIER 5: GENETIC VERIFICATION HYPOTHESES

### **H5.1: Autosomal DNA Match with Bodzia**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 20%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Autosomal DNA may show weak affinity to Bodzia cemetery samples, but low-SNP-count matches alone are not evidence of direct descent.

**Evidence Required:**
- High-resolution autosomal results with segment-level data
- Replicable matches across platforms or independent datasets
- Clear documentation of match quality thresholds

**Verification Steps:**
1. Upload autosomal DNA to MyTrueAncestry.com (exploratory only)
2. Record match strength and SNP counts
3. Seek independent segment-level validation

**Expected Outcome:** Possible affinity signal; not proof of a direct Bodzia line.

---

### **H5.2: Autosomal DNA Match with Kievan Rus'**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 25%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Autosomal DNA may show weak affinity to Rus' period samples, but low-SNP-count matches are not sufficient to confirm direct ancestry.

**Evidence Required:**
- High-resolution autosomal results with segment-level data
- Independent replication of matches
- Clear documentation of sample quality and coverage

**Verification Steps:**
1. Treat existing MyTrueAncestry matches as exploratory
2. Analyze additional Rus' period samples with better coverage
3. Compare results with multiple carriers of I-Y45113 sub-branches

**Expected Outcome:** Possible regional affinity; not confirmation of elite ancestry.

---

### **H5.3: Y-DNA TMRCA (Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor) Calculation**
**Status:** Partially Supported (clean Y-STR data now available; Doug excluded until Big Y completed)  
**Confidence:** 68% (up from 55%; clean Y-STR distance data available; YFull age refinement confirmed)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** With comparable Y-STR or SNP data from the four core individuals (Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw), a TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) estimate can be calculated. Doug Skory can be added as a fifth comparator once Big Y-700 is confirmed (H0.1). Method confidence is high, but date precision is moderate due to partial STR coverage, so YFull STR distances (from YTree analysis) and YFull branch TMRCA estimates are the best available proxies.

**Evidence Present (January 2026 Update):**
- Aleksei confirms clean Y-STR distances: Wladyslaw (4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei); Doug Skory (2/25, 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei)
- YFull age refinement confirmed: I-Y224059 TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) ~700 ybp (years before present; Aleksei notes: "I did not know that YFull decreased the age of our branch to 700 years")
- Doug Skory Big Y-700 NOT completed (H0.1); excluded from calculations until completed

**Evidence Required:**
- Consistent Y-STR panels (Y37/Y67/Y111) for all four individuals, or Big Y/YFull (comprehensive Y-DNA test; YFull analyzes BAM/VCF files) results
- Wladyslaw terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) placement (YFull upload (BAM or VCF file) recommended by Aleksei)
- Doug Skory Big Y-700 completion (H0.1)
- Cleaned STR calls (resolve `?` entries; reduce `n/a` gaps)
- Documented mutation rate assumptions and comparison method

**Verification Steps:**
1. Use YFull STR distances (from YTree analysis) as interim estimates (e.g., YF089989 7/462; YF003943 15/431)
2. Obtain full STR panels or Big Y results for all four individuals
3. Normalize marker sets to a shared panel
4. Calculate pairwise distances and TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) with confidence intervals

**Expected Outcome:** A dated estimate of lineage divergence with clear uncertainty bounds, cross-checked against YFull branch TMRCA (YTree branch age estimates) values.

### **H5.5: Marcin Radzimowski (Tarnobrzeg) Autosomal Link**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 75%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Marcin Radzimowski (Tarnobrzeg, Podkarpackie) is a collateral relative (MyHeritage match: ~5th cousin, ~21 cM shared DNA) within the Podkarpackie cluster and may carry an I-Y45113 lineage.

**Evidence Required:**
- Marcin's Y-DNA test (Y37/Y67/Y111 or Big Y/YFull (comprehensive Y-DNA test; YFull analyzes BAM/VCF files))
- Confirmation of the autosomal match (segment data) and genealogical tree
- Location/time alignment with Tarnobrzeg/Jadachy/Sokołów Małopolski cluster

**Verification Steps:**
1. Contact Marcin Radzimowski via MyHeritage; request Y-DNA test (FTDNA/YSEQ) and share of segment data
2. Align his paternal line with Tarnobrzeg records; request family tree extracts
3. Compare Y-DNA (if tested) to I-Y224059/I-Y45233 carriers; compute STR/SNP distance

**Expected Outcome:** Validates/refutes Podkarpackie clustering and may add another modern comparator under I-Y45113.

### **H5.6: Ciepłe (Gniew) Early Medieval Elite Link**
**Status:** Speculative  
**Confidence:** 20%  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Hypothesis:** The northern Pomeranian Radzimowski cluster (H3.7) may share deep ancestry with early medieval elites associated with the Ciepłe cemetery (late 10th–early 11th century), but confirmation requires ancient DNA.

**Evidence Present (Verified Archaeology):**
- UW archaeology project describes the Ciepłe settlement complex (Tczew County) as late 10th/early 11th century and tied to early Piast expansion and Vistula trade routes.
- Antiquity reports richly furnished chamber graves at Ciepłe indicating elite status; strontium suggests both local and western Scandinavian origins.
- Gdańsk Archaeological Museum project notes elite burials and ongoing analyses, with cultural traits linked to Scandinavian, Rus’, and Slavic traditions.

**Evidence Required:**
- Published aDNA/Y‑DNA haplogroup data from Ciepłe (if available)
- Confirmed Y‑DNA from the northern Radzimowski cluster (H3.7)
- Comparative analysis between I‑Y45113 and any Ciepłe/Bodzia Y‑DNA profiles

**Verification Steps:**
1. Review publications from the Ciepłe project for aDNA results
2. Contact the Ciepłe research team about Y‑DNA availability/comparison
3. Test living male-line descendants from the northern cluster (H3.7)
4. Compare Y‑DNA with any published Ciepłe/Bodzia haplogroups

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or refutes a deep-time link between the northern Radzimowski cluster and early medieval elites.

**Outreach Note (Draft, Ciepłe Project Team):**
Subject: Inquiry on Ciepłe aDNA/Y‑DNA results for comparative genealogy  
Hello Dr. Wadyl / Ciepłe Project Team,  
I’m conducting a genealogical study of a Radzimowski male line documented in the Gniew/Piaseczno area (17th–20th c.). We have Y‑DNA results (I‑Y45113) and are exploring whether any published or unpublished aDNA/Y‑DNA data from the Ciepłe cemetery might be suitable for comparison.  
Could you advise whether Y‑DNA haplogroups or BAM/VCF-level data (BAM: compressed binary alignment; VCF: variant call format) are available (or planned) for the Ciepłe burials, and if external comparison is possible?  
Thank you for your time, and I’m happy to share our summary and consented Y‑DNA details if helpful.  
Best regards,  
[Name / affiliation]  
[Contact]

**aDNA/Y‑DNA Comparison Checklist:**
1. Confirm Ciepłe sample list and accession IDs in publications  
2. Determine if Y‑DNA haplogroups are reported; request if not published  
3. Ensure modern Y‑DNA test type and coverage (Big Y/YFull (comprehensive Y-DNA test)) are documented  
4. Normalize terminology (Y‑SNP nomenclature and build version)  
5. Compare haplogroup placement on a common tree (YFull/FTDNA (YTree vs FTDNA's Y-DNA tree))  
6. Record uncertainty (coverage, contamination, sample quality)  
7. Document permissions and ethical constraints for any data use

## TIER 6: SPECIALIZED RESEARCH HYPOTHESES

### **H6.1: Ukrainian Radzymowski Connection**
**Status:** Evidence Present — **Testing Required**
**Confidence:** 45% (up from 30%; Wikipedia documents multiple notable Ukrainian Radzimovsky families)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (upgraded from MEDIUM)

**Hypothesis:** Ukrainian Radzymowski families (Радзимовський spelling) may be patrilineal cousins of the Polish branch. Y-DNA testing would determine if they share the I-Y45113 lineage.

**Etymology Link:** See "SURNAME ETYMOLOGY & HISTORICAL CONTEXT" section above — Радзимовський is the Cyrillic orthographic form of Radzimowski, both deriving from the town of Radzymin (chartered 1475). This is a **script change**, not a separate surname.

**⚠️ January 2026 Update — Ukrainian Radzimovsky Evidence:**
Ukrainian Wikipedia (uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Радзимовський) documents multiple notable Radzimovsky individuals in Ukraine spanning 19th-21st centuries:

| Person | Dates | Role | Location |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| Віталій Іванович Радзимовський | 1905-1975 | Engineer, engineering mechanics specialist | Ukraine → USA |
| Ольга Іванівна Радзимовська | 1905-? | Doctor of medicine | Ukraine |
| Дмитро Олександрович Радзимовський | 1903-1985 | Hydrobiologist, NASU Institute | Kyiv |
| Радзимовський (first name unknown) | 1917-1918 | Court judge, Russian Orthodox Council member | Kyiv |
| Іоанн Радзимовський | 19th c. | Protopriest, built first stone church in Zvenyhorodka | Cherkasy region |
| Петро Едуардович Радзимовський | ~1906 | Teacher at Romny women's gymnasium | Poltava region |
| Броніслав Казимирович Радзимовський | Contemporary | Information security specialist | Odesa |

**Critical Observation:** These families **retained the Radzimowski surname** in Ukraine for multiple generations. This challenges the assumption that migrants necessarily changed surnames (see H3.3 revision).

**Geographic Distribution:** Ukrainian Radzimovskys documented in:
- Kyiv (scientists, judges)
- Cherkasy region (clergy)
- Poltava region (educators)
- Odesa (contemporary)

**Implications for H3.3:**
If Ukrainian Radzimovskys are tested and found to carry I-Y45113:
1. Confirms shared patrilineal ancestry with Polish Radzimowski
2. Suggests the lineage was present in both Poland and Ukraine historically
3. Complicates the "Berezhnoy = migrants who changed surname" narrative

**Evidence Required:**
- Y-DNA testing of Ukrainian Radzymowski male-line descendants
- Family trees showing Ukrainian branch origins
- Historical records linking Ukrainian Radzimovsky families to Polish origins (or indigenous Ukrainian development)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Identify living male-line Ukrainian Radzimovsky descendants (via Wikipedia references, Ukrainian genealogical societies)
2. Contact and request Y-DNA testing (FTDNA Y-37/Y-67/Y-111 or Big Y-700)
3. Compare Y-DNA with Polish Radzimowski (Andrzej's I-Y224059)
4. If match confirmed: Calculate TMRCA between Polish and Ukrainian branches
5. Document whether Ukrainian branch is under I-Y224059, I-Y45233, or a separate I-Y45113 sub-branch

**Expected Outcome:** Either confirms shared I-Y45113 lineage (supporting dual-region presence since medieval times) or reveals separate Y-DNA lineage (surname coincidence or heraldic adoption without genetic connection).

**🔬 Publication Potential:**
If Ukrainian Radzimovsky tests **positive for I-Y45113**, this would be publishable:

> **"Y-DNA Evidence of Polish-Ukrainian Patrilineal Continuity in the Radzimowski/Радзимовський Family, 1475-2026"**

Such a paper would demonstrate:
1. ✅ Ukrainian Радзимовськs and Polish Radzimowski share a common male-line ancestor
2. ✅ The surname (same family, different alphabets) preserved genetic identity across ~500 years
3. ✅ Migration/settlement occurred during Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth era (1569-1795)
4. ✅ Family persisted through Russian Empire, Soviet period, and into modern Ukraine

**Important Caveat:** A positive I-Y45113 result confirms **shared patrilineal ancestry** but does NOT definitively prove migration direction. The lineage could have:
- Originated in Poland and migrated to Ukraine (traditional narrative)
- Originated in Ukraine and migrated to Poland (reverse flow)
- Been present in both regions since medieval times (dual-origin)

Additional evidence (documentary records, autosomal DNA, TMRCA calculations) would be needed to distinguish between these scenarios.

### **H6.2: Linguistic Etymology Analysis**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 30%  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Hypothesis:** Surname etymologies may reflect place-name or occupational origins, but this requires independent linguistic and historical evidence.

**Evidence Required:**
- Place name research
- Historical linguistic analysis
- Early surname usage patterns

**Verification Steps:**
1. Research place names matching surnames
2. Analyze linguistic roots
3. Check early surname variations
4. Compare with historical naming patterns

**Expected Outcome:** Clarifies surname origins.

---

## TIER 7: NEGATIVE CONTROL HYPOTHESES (To Rule Out)

### **H7.1: Two Unrelated Radzimowski Lineages**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** Unknown (no data)  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Hypothesis:** Andrzej's Radzimowski lineage and the Podkarpackie Radzimowski families represent two separate lineages with different Y-DNA, connected only through heraldic clan membership.

**Evidence Required:**
- Different Y-DNA haplogroups
- No autosomal DNA matches
- Separate geographic origins

**Verification Steps:**
1. Compare Y-DNA haplogroups
2. Check autosomal DNA matches
3. Analyze geographic distribution

**Expected Outcome:** If confirmed, rules out patrilineal connection.

---

### **H7.2: Berezhnoy Not Connected**
**Status:** Disfavored (YFull (YTree database) confirms Aleksei I-Y45233 under I-Y45113)  
**Confidence:** 10%  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Hypothesis:** Aleksei Berezhnoy's Y-DNA lineage is not related to the Polish Radzimowski-Garboś-Mazgaj cluster.

**Evidence Required:**
- Different Y-DNA haplogroup
- No shared autosomal DNA
- Different migration patterns

**Verification Steps:**
1. Compare family histories
2. Analyze geographic origins
3. Check autosomal DNA matches

**Expected Outcome:** If confirmed, rules out connection.

## DECISION TREE (Y-DNA OUTCOMES)

- **Wladyslaw = I-Y224059** → H1.1 confidence ↑; four-way cluster confirmed under I-Y45113 with Andrzej/Artur. Proceed to STR/SNP TMRCA (H5.3).
- **Wladyslaw = I-Y45233** → Two-sister-branch model; integrate with Aleksei; revisit migration hypotheses (H3.3).
- **Wladyslaw ≠ I-Y45113** → Pivot to heraldic-only linkage; H7.1 risk increases; keep Artur/Aleksei/Andrzej cluster intact.
- **Doug Skory Big Y (if available)** → Place on I-Y45113 tree; if I-Y224059 or I-Y45233, add as fifth modern comparator for TMRCA; if different, treat as parallel branch for Ukraine/USA migration.

## NOTES

- Current SNP/STR evidence covers Andrzej (I-Y224059); Aleksei is placed at I-Y45233 via YFull matches, but no raw SNP/STR file is present here for him.
- YFull tree data provided by the user indicates: I-Y45113 formed ~3800 ybp (years before present, per YFull definition: years ago before current year, not 1950-based) (TMRCA ~1050 ybp), I-Y224059 formed ~1050 ybp (TMRCA ~700 ybp), I-Y45233 formed ~1050 ybp (TMRCA ~200 ybp).
- **January 2026 Update (Aleksei's email):** YFull age refinement to ~700 ybp confirmed; Aleksei notes surprise at this update. Wladyslaw Y-STR distances confirmed (4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei). Doug Skory Y-STR distances confirmed (2/25, 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei). Doug Skory Big Y-700 NOT completed despite 2022 funding commitment. Wladyslaw is NOT Aleksei's Family Finder cousin (no autosomal DNA sharing, consistent with deep-lineage patrilineal connection).
- `data/raw/y_dna_results/STR_statistic_for_YF079056.csv` flags private mutations (DYS608, DYS562, DYS389II, DYS471, DYS576) and branch-level STR stats for I-Y224059 and I-Y45113.
- `data/raw/y_dna_results/YFull _ STR matches3.pdf` is a longer distant-match list with diverse terminal haplogroups (Terminal Hg: youngest branch); it adds breadth but not direct lineage proof.
- Autosomal ancient DNA matching at low SNP counts should be treated as exploratory signals, not proof of direct descent.
- Confidence levels are provisional and should be updated only with verifiable genetic or archival evidence.
- Negative control hypotheses help rule out alternative explanations.
- Core Y-DNA comparator set: Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw; Doug becomes a fifth comparator if H0.1 is confirmed.
- Skory integration (contact strategy, Big Y status, migration branch) is documented in `docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md`; refer there for details and outreach steps.

**Last Review Date:** January 18, 2026 (added RA.1-RA.5: VK157-VK542 Y-DNA mismatch; Finnish autosomal affinity; VK155-VK157 Emnilda connection; Ottonian Princess theory with Genealogia Welforum evidence; I-Z63 European Elite Network with von Plotho/Warenne/Stanhope/Erzya connections)
**Next Review:** After Doug Skory and Wladyslaw Mazgaj contact/responses; Ukrainian Radzimovsky outreach; VK542 haplogroup independent verification; Emnilda genealogy historical verification; Genealogia Welforum "regi Rugorum" full text verification; von Plotho terminal SNP verification

## JANUARY 2026 REVISION NOTE: UKRAINIAN RADZIMOVSKY FAMILIES

**Source:** Ukrainian Wikipedia (uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Радзимовський)

**Discovery:** Multiple notable Ukrainian Radzimovsky (Радзимовський) families documented in Ukraine spanning 19th-21st centuries, who retained the Radzimowski surname rather than adopting Ukrainian alternatives.

**Impact on Research:**
1. **H3.3 (Berezhnoy Migration):** Confidence reduced from 45% to **25%**. The simple "Poland → Ukraine migration with surname change" narrative is now questioned. Two key factors:
   - Ukrainian Radzimovskys kept their surname — why would Aleksei's ancestors have adopted "Berezhnoy"?
   - **Aleksei's Polish fluency is self-taught** (his parents did NOT speak Polish) — this is NOT evidence of Polish family origins

2. **H6.1 (Ukrainian Radzymowski Connection):** Confidence increased from 30% to 45%, priority upgraded from MEDIUM to HIGH. Y-DNA testing of Ukrainian Radzimovsky male-line descendants is now a priority to determine if they share I-Y45113 lineage.

3. **Alternative Model:** The I-Y45113 lineage may have been present in both Poland and Ukraine since medieval times (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth era), rather than originating exclusively in Poland with later migration to Ukraine.

**Action Items:**
- Identify living male-line Ukrainian Radzimovsky descendants for Y-DNA testing
- Interview Aleksei about family oral history regarding Polish origins vs. continuous Ukrainian presence
- Search Ukrainian archives for earliest "Berezhnoy" records in Aleksei's family village
