## SURNAME ETYMOLOGY & HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Radzymin → Radzimowski → Радзимовський Origin Chain

The Radzimowski surname derives from the Polish town of **Radzymin** (near Warsaw), chartered in 1475. The transformation follows standard Polish-Ukrainian linguistic patterns:

**1. Polish Formation (1475-1500s)**
- Noble families living near Radzymin adopted the surname **Radzimowski** ("of/from Radzymin")
- The **-ski suffix** indicates "of or from a place" — a common Polish nobility naming pattern
- First documented usage: Radzimowic, Płock region, 1552 (see H2.1)

**2. Ukrainian Adoption (1500s-1700s)**
- During the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Polish families settled in Ukrainian territories
- Ukrainian speakers retained the surname but adapted to Cyrillic orthography:
  - Polish **-ski** → Ukrainian **-ський**
  - **Radzimowski** → **Радзимовський**
- This is a **script/alphabet change**, not a semantic translation — the surname meaning is identical

**3. Geographic Split (1795 Partitions)**
After Poland's partitions (1772-1795):
- **Polish territories** → Prussian/Austrian/Russian control → surnames often Germanized or Russified
- **Ukrainian territories** → Russian Empire → Ukrainian surnames preserved in Cyrillic
- **Result:** ~185+ Радзимовськs documented in Ukraine; significantly fewer Radzimowskis remain in Poland

### Implications for Research

This etymology establishes that Polish Radzimowski and Ukrainian Радзимовський are **orthographic variants of the same surname**, not separate family names. If male-line descendants of both branches share I-Y45113:
- Confirms **patrilineal continuity** across the Polish-Ukrainian linguistic boundary
- Suggests migration or settlement during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth era (1569-1795)
- Does NOT definitively establish migration direction — the lineage may have been present in both regions since medieval times (see H3.3 alternative interpretations)

## TIER 0: URGENT PRE-VERIFICATION (SKORY INTEGRATION)

### **H0.1: Doug Skory Big Y-700 Confirmation**
**Status:** Not Completed (4-year delay; Aleksei confirms test not ordered as of January 2026)  
**Confidence:** 25% (down from 50%; higher abandonment risk after 4-year delay)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Doug Skory's Big Y-700 test was completed and places him under I-Y45113 (likely I-Y224059 or I-Y45233), adding a fifth modern comparator to the core Y-DNA set.

**Update (January 2026):** Aleksei confirms: "Unfortunately, Skory did not order the BigY test yet. We need to contact him and his relatives again about it." Despite funding commitment from February 2022 ($239), test remains uncompleted after 4-year delay. Immediate re-contact required.

**Evidence Required:**
- Confirmation of Big Y-700 completion
- FTDNA kit number or YFull link (YFxxxxx kit identifier, if available)
- Raw SNP data (optional but preferred)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Contact Judith/Doug to confirm Big Y-700 status
2. Obtain kit number and access to results
3. Upload to YFull if not already done
4. Add Doug to TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) analysis (H5.3) once data is available

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or rules out Doug as a fifth comparator under I-Y45113.

### **H0.2: Casimir Skory Priest Connection (Grand Rapids)**
**Status:** Supported (user-provided images + published local history; verification pending)  
**Confidence:** 95%  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Casimir Skory (Poland-born) served as pastor at St. Adalbert’s Church in Grand Rapids, and documentary records link him to Louis Skory at the church address (Fourth & Davis), establishing a concrete Skory anchor in the Grand Rapids Polish community.

**Evidence Present (User-Provided):**
- Michigan death certificate lists Casimir Skory as a pastor at St. Adalbert’s Church; birthplace Poland; informant Louis Skory; address Fourth & Davis.
- Newspaper clipping (La Patrie, Montreal, 1910) names Rev. Casimir Skory as celebrant for Stanley Ketchel’s funeral in Grand Rapids.
- History Grand Rapids Historical Commission photo essay “A Tale of Two Cities: Trzemeszno & Grand Rapids” (Maciej Adamski & Diana Barrett, Nov 23, 2010) describes Fr. Casimir Skory arriving in Grand Rapids in 1894, prior immigration to Bay City with his mother/stepfather Michael Kowalski (1875), and his death in March 1935. (Content from user-provided excerpt; independent verification pending.)

**Discrepancy Notes:**
- Birth year and death date conflict across sources (death certificate shows 1884 birth / 1925 death; local history states arrival 1894 and death March 1935). Possible misread, transcription error, or multiple individuals.

**Evidence Required:**
- Certified death certificate copy to resolve date discrepancy
- Independent access to the History Grand Rapids photo essay for full citation
- Parish/archdiocese records confirming tenure and family ties
- Identification of Louis Skory relationship (nephew/relative) via census or city directories

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain certified death certificate and reconcile 1925 vs 1935 dates
2. Capture full citation and archival copy of the History Grand Rapids photo essay
3. Request St. Adalbert/archdiocese personnel records for Casimir Skory (ordination, assignments)
4. Locate Louis Skory in Grand Rapids records (1900-1930) and confirm relationship

**Expected Outcome:** Establishes a documented Grand Rapids Skory anchor and clarifies the Casimir/Louis connection.

### **H0.3: Fr. Casimir Skory Family Link to Doug’s Skory Line**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 55%  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Fr. Casimir Skory (Trzemeszno → Grand Rapids) is a close relative (brother/cousin/uncle) of Anthony/Casimer Skory in Doug’s lineage, providing a direct documentary bridge from Trzemeszno to the Grand Rapids/Traverse City Skory line.

**Evidence Present (User-Provided):**
- Fr. Casimir Skory and Doug’s known Skory ancestors both trace to Trzemeszno.
- John R. Skory was born in Grand Rapids in 1895 during Fr. Casimir’s pastorate.
- The Casimir/Louis Skory records point to a Skory family presence at St. Adalbert’s during the relevant period.

**Evidence Required:**
- Trzemeszno parish registers linking Casimir/Anthony/Casimer Skory lines
- St. Adalbert baptism/marriage records for Anthony Skory or his children
- City directories/census records establishing family relationships (Skory/Kowalski households)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Search Trzemeszno parish registers for Skory family clusters (1850-1885)
2. Query St. Adalbert baptism/marriage records for Anthony/John R. Skory
3. Cross-check Grand Rapids city directories and census records for kinship ties

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or refutes the close familial relationship between Fr. Casimir Skory and Doug’s Skory line.

## TIER 1: FOUNDATIONAL Y-DNA HYPOTHESES (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### **H1.1: Patrilineal Y-DNA Connection**
**Status:** Partially Supported (Andrzej + Artur I-Y224059; Aleksei I-Y45233; Wladyslaw Y-STR confirmed, terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) pending)  
**Confidence:** 73% (up from 70%; Wladyslaw's confirmed Y-STR distances strengthen clustering)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Andrzej Radzimowski and a documented Garboś line share I-Y224059; Aleksei Berezhnoy is I-Y45233 within the same parent branch I-Y45113. If Wladyslaw Mazgaj is also under I-Y45113, the shared patrilineal ancestor predates the split between I-Y224059 and I-Y45233.

**Evidence Present:**
- SNPs confirm Andrzej as I-Y224059.
- YFull SNP matches show YF089989 (I-Y224059; Artur Garboś; MDA Józef Garboś b. 1710, Poland).
- YFull SNP matches show YF003943/YF108111 as I-Y45233 (Ukraine).
- YFull STR matches include close matches to YF089989 (7/462) and YF003943 (15/431).
- Aleksei confirms Wladyslaw Mazgaj Y-STR distances: 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei (January 2026).
- Aleksei predicts: "It is very likely that Wladislaw will form a new young sub branch together with Artur" (suggests I-Y224059 placement).
- Aleksei notes identical Y111 distance (10/111) for both Wladyslaw and Doug Skory, suggesting potential sub-branch formation (see H1.5).

**Evidence Required:**
- Terminal SNP (Terminal Hg: haplogroup branch with youngest estimated age)/kit/YFull link (YFxxxxx kit identifier) for Wladyslaw Mazgaj; raw STR/SNP data if available
- Optional: raw SNP/STR data for Aleksei for independent verification

**Verification Steps:**
1. Anchor Andrzej's haplogroup using SNP and YFull matches (I-Y224059)
2. Record YF089989 as Artur Garboś's YFull kit; add documentation if needed
3. Obtain Wladyslaw's terminal SNP (Terminal Hg)/kit (and upload to YFull if possible); place him on the I-Y45113 tree
4. Use YFull TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) plus comparable STRs for refined MRCA dating (including Wladyslaw if data allows)

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms whether all four sit under I-Y45113 and identifies which sub-branches connect directly (I-Y224059 vs I-Y45233). If Wladyslaw is I-Y45113, confidence increases; if not, this becomes a two-branch model.

### **H1.2: Kievan Rus' Origins**
**Status:** Speculative  
**Confidence:** 25%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** The I-Y45113 lineage may have a medieval East Slavic (Kievan Rus') geographic affinity. Autosomal affinity signals exist in MTA results, but they do not demonstrate direct descent or elite status.

**Evidence Required:**
- Independent, high-resolution autosomal or Y-DNA evidence linking the lineage to specific Rus' samples
- Published ancient DNA with clear Y-DNA placement relative to I-Y45113 sub-branches
- Geographic distribution analysis of I-Y45113 with primary or peer-reviewed sources

**Verification Steps:**
1. Treat MyTrueAncestry matches as exploratory signals only
2. Seek SNP-based aDNA comparisons with defined coverage/quality
3. Correlate lineage distribution with historical records and migrations

**Expected Outcome:** At best, a supported regional affinity; not proof of elite ancestry without stronger evidence.

---

### **H1.3: Bodzia Cemetery Connection**
**Status:** Speculative  
**Confidence:** 20%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** There may be a population-level affinity between the lineage and Bodzia cemetery individuals, but current evidence does not show direct descent.

**Evidence Required:**
- aDNA Y-DNA data from Bodzia samples with sub-branch resolution relative to I-Y45113
- Robust autosomal segment comparisons (not small-SNP-count matches)
- Independent archaeological or documentary correlation

**Verification Steps:**
1. Use MyTrueAncestry only as a lead, not as confirmation
2. Confirm Y-haplogroup placement of Bodzia samples and whether any fall within or near I-Y45113
3. Compare autosomal segments with reliable coverage thresholds

**Expected Outcome:** Possible regional/period affinity; direct line-of-descent requires stronger genetic evidence.

---

### **H1.4: Wladyslaw Mazgaj Y-DNA Placement**
**Status:** Partially Supported (Y-STR distances confirmed; terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) pending)  
**Confidence:** 78% (up from 75%; clean Y-STR data confirms cousin-level connection)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Wladyslaw Mazgaj is within I-Y45113 (likely I-Y224059 or I-Y45233), consistent with the Radzimowski-Garboś-Berezhnoy cluster.

**Evidence Present (January 2026 Update):**
- Aleksei confirms Y-STR distances: 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 mutations from Aleksei
- Y111 distance of 10/111 confirms cousin-level connection (consistent with I-Y45113)
- Aleksei notes: "Wladislaw Mazgay is not my Family Finder cousin" (no autosomal DNA sharing, consistent with deep-lineage patrilineal connection)

**Evidence Required:**
- Wladyslaw's terminal SNP (Terminal Hg)/kit/YFull link (YFxxxxx kit identifier; Aleksei suggests contacting Wladyslaw to join YFull)
- Full Y-STR haplotype for comparison with Doug Skory (Aleksei suggests: "Mazgay and Skory can be very close to each other if their mutations are the same")

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain Wladyslaw's terminal SNP (Terminal Hg)/kit (and YFull upload (BAM or VCF file) if possible)
2. Place his terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) on the I-Y45113 tree
3. Confirm Y111 haplotype; incorporate distance into TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) calculations (H5.3)
4. Update H1.1 confidence based on placement

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or rejects the four-way patrilineal hypothesis.

---

### **H1.5: Wladyslaw-Doug Skory Sub-Branch Formation** (NEW)
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 40% (conditional on haplotype comparison)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Wladyslaw Mazgaj and Doug Skory form a distinct sub-branch within I-Y45113 (likely under I-Y224059), closer to each other than either is to Aleksei, suggesting a shared ancestor more recent than the I-Y45113 split (~1050 ybp (years before present)) but older than the I-Y224059 formation (~700 ybp).

**Evidence Present (January 2026):**
- Aleksei notes identical Y111 distance (10/111) for both Wladyslaw and Doug from Aleksei
- Different intermediate marker patterns (Wladyslaw: 4/37, 6/67; Doug: 2/25, 4/37, 6/67) suggest they are NOT siblings but may be cousins
- Aleksei suggests: "So Mazgay and Skory can be very close to each other if their mutations are the same"
- Aleksei predicts: "It is very likely that Wladislaw will form a new young sub branch together with Artur"

**Evidence Required:**
- Direct haplotype comparison between Wladyslaw and Doug (full Y-STR panels)
- Terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) placement for both (YFull uploads (BAM or VCF files from Big Y tests))
- Confirmation that their mutations align (Aleksei's suggestion)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain full Y-STR haplotypes for both Wladyslaw and Doug
2. Compare marker-by-marker for alignment
3. Determine terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) placement for both (YFull uploads)
4. Calculate pairwise TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) if sub-branch confirmed
5. Compare with Artur's haplotype to test "new sub branch together with Artur" hypothesis

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or refutes close relationship between Wladyslaw and Doug; refines phylogenetic model; may identify new sub-branch under I-Y224059.

## RURIKID DYNASTY Y-DNA ANALYSIS (Ancient DNA Context)

### **RA.1: VK157-VK542 Y-DNA Mismatch — Rurikid Non-Paternity Event**
**Status:** Critical Observation — Requires Genealogical Revision
**Confidence:** 95% (Y-DNA haplogroups are definitive; identifications are hypothetical)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (impacts interpretation of VK157 = Svyatopolk hypothesis)
**Cross-reference:** See **RA.3** for VK155-VK157 Emnilda evidence that strengthens VK157 = Svyatopolk identification

**Observation:** Ancient DNA samples VK157 and VK542 have **incompatible Y-DNA haplogroups** despite both being attributed to the Rurikid dynasty context.

**⚠️ CRITICAL CLARIFICATION (January 2026):**

The identification of both samples requires careful distinction:

| Sample | Commonly Cited Identity | Alternate Identity | Y-DNA | Death Date |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| VK157 | Svyatopolk I (son of Yaropolk I) | Unknown Bodzia elite | **I1-S2077** | ~1019 CE |
| VK542 | **Gleb Svyatoslavich** (d. 1078) | NOT Gleb Vladimirovich (d. 1015) | **I2-Y4460** | 1078 CE |

**Important:** VK542 is identified in peer-reviewed Rurikid genetic studies as **Gleb Svyatoslavich** (d. 1078), the son of Svyatoslav II and great-great-grandson of Vladimir the Great — NOT as Gleb Vladimirovich (d. 1015), who was Vladimir's direct son. This changes the genealogical relationship but does NOT invalidate the NPE conclusion.

**The Problem:** I1 and I2 haplogroups diverged **~25,000+ years ago**. If both individuals are patrilineal descendants of Svyatoslav the Brave, they **must** share the same Y-DNA haplogroup. The mismatch proves at least one **non-paternity event (NPE)** occurred somewhere in the Rurikid line.

**Corrected Genealogical Context:**
```
                    Svyatoslav the Brave (942-972)
                               │
              ┌────────────────┴────────────────┐
          Yaropolk I                      Vladimir the Great
          (d. 980)                           (d. 1015)
              │                                  │

         (VK157?, d. 1019)                   (d. 1054)
         I1-S2077                                │
              │                           Svyatoslav II
              │                             (d. 1076)
              │                                  │
              │                        Gleb Svyatoslavich
              │                         (VK542, d. 1078)
              │                            I2-Y4460
              │                                  │
              └────── 4 GENERATIONS GAP ─────────┘
                     Y-DNA MISMATCH STILL PROVES NPE
```

**Why the NPE conclusion remains valid:**
- Even with 4 generations between VK157 and VK542, Y-DNA should be identical if patrilineal continuity existed
- The I1 vs. I2 mismatch proves an NPE occurred **somewhere** in the Rurikid male line
- Most likely location: Vladimir's lineage (his mother Malusha was a slave/concubine)

**Historical Note:** According to the chronicle narrative (as depicted in the Russian TV series "The Rurik Dynasty"), Vladimir killed his brother Yaropolk and took Yaropolk's pregnant wife. The child born was Svyatopolk — so he was supposedly Yaropolk's biological son, not Vladimir's.

**⚠️ Identification Caveats:**

Both identifications remain **hypothetical**, not confirmed:

1. **VK157 = Svyatopolk I**: Supported by RA.3 (Emnilda/VK155) and RA.4 (Ottonian princess) evidence, but NOT definitively proven
2. **VK542 = Gleb Svyatoslavich**: Cited in Rurikid genetic studies and MyTrueAncestry, but requires independent verification

**Rurikid Y-DNA Complexity:**

Published Rurikid-context ancient DNA shows **multiple Y-haplogroups**:

| Sample/Individual | Y-Haplogroup | Context |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| VK157 (Bodzia) | I1-S2077 | Svyatopolk hypothesis |
| VK542 | I2-Y4460 | Gleb Svyatoslavich attribution |
| Prince Dmitry Alexandrovich | N1a1a1a1a1a1a7a | Rurikid (verified) |
| Other Rurikid-context samples | R1a, N1a, I2a | Various attributions |

This diversity suggests the "Rurikids" as a political dynasty need not map to a single Y-DNA haplogroup — whether due to sample identity uncertainty, non-paternity events, or sampling different branches.

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Svyatopolk was NOT Yaropolk's biological son**
   - Yaropolk's wife may have been pregnant by someone else
   - The I1-S2077 Y-DNA came from an unknown father
   - Vladimir's court may have claimed Yaropolk paternity for political reasons

2. **Vladimir was NOT Svyatoslav's biological son**
   - Vladimir's mother Malusha was a slave/concubine
   - Svyatoslav may not have been Vladimir's biological father
   - This would explain why Vladimir's descendants (Gleb = I2-Y4460) have different Y-DNA

3. **Yaropolk was NOT Svyatoslav's biological son**
   - NPE in the senior line
   - Less likely historically documented, but genetically possible

4. **VK157 is NOT Svyatopolk**
   - The identification is a hypothesis, not confirmed
   - VK157 may be another elite individual buried at Bodzia
   - The I1-S2077 lineage may represent a different family entirely

5. **Neither line carries "original Rurik" Y-DNA**
   - Both Yaropolk and Vladimir may have different biological fathers
   - The "Rurikid" dynasty was a political construct, not genetic continuity
   - Medieval royal successions often involved legitimization regardless of biological paternity

**Finnish Autosomal Affinity — Challenging the "Swedish Connection":**

The Nature 2020 paper "Population genomics of the Viking world" (PMID 32939067) shows VK157's autosomal DNA clusters with modern **Finnish** populations, not Swedish. Combined with:
- I1-S2077 has a strong **PR683 branch** with significant Finnish representation (FTDNA Y700 testing)
- The traditional narrative places Rurik's origin in **Sweden**

**Question:** Where is the Swedish connection in the genetic data? The "Varangian" origin of the Rurikids may have been Finnish/Baltic rather than Swedish.

**Implications for Project Research:**

This VK157-VK542 mismatch is directly relevant to the project because:
1. VK157 (I1-S2077) is **ancestral** to I-Y45113 (the APR/Andrzej haplogroup)
2. If VK157 is NOT Svyatopolk, the "Rurikid connection" hypothesis weakens
3. If VK157 IS Svyatopolk, it suggests an NPE in the Rurikid dynasty
4. Either way, the APR lineage's connection is to the **I1-S2077 population**, not necessarily to "Rurikid royalty"

**Evidence Sources:**
- VK157 haplogroup: FTDNA 2020, [haplotree.info I-S2077 map](https://haplotree.info/maps/ancient_dna/slideshow_samples.php?searchcolumn=Y_Haplotree_Variant&searchfor=I-S2077&ybp=500000,0)
- VK542 (Gleb) haplogroup: MyTrueAncestry listing as I2-Y4460
- Finnish autosomal affinity: Nature 2020, "Population genomics of the Viking world" (PMID 32939067)
- Genealogical context: Russian TV series "The Rurik Dynasty" Episode 2, timestamp 21:50 ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDlirAhgwzs))

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm VK542 Y-DNA haplogroup independently (seek primary publication data)
2. Review all published Rurikid-era ancient DNA for Y-DNA consistency
3. Document which historical Rurikid descendants have been Y-DNA tested
4. Compare VK157's Finnish autosomal affinity with Swedish Viking samples
5. Investigate whether other I1-S2077 ancient samples show Finnish vs. Swedish clustering

**Expected Outcome:** Either:
- Identifies which Rurikid line(s) experienced NPE(s)
- OR refutes the VK157 = Svyatopolk identification
- OR reveals that the Rurikid genetic legacy is more complex than dynastic records suggest

### **RA.2: VK157 Finnish vs. Swedish Autosomal Affinity**
**Status:** Supported by Published Research
**Confidence:** 80% (Nature 2020 paper)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** VK157's autosomal DNA shows closer affinity to modern **Finnish** populations than to Swedish populations, challenging the traditional narrative of Swedish Varangian origins for the Rurikid dynasty.

**Evidence Present:**
- Nature 2020 "Population genomics of the Viking world" (PMID 32939067) — VK157 clusters with Finnish populations
- I1-S2077 haplogroup has strong Finnish representation in the PR683 branch (FTDNA Y700 data)
- Bodzia cemetery (where VK157 was buried) is in Poland, not Sweden

**Implications:**
1. The "Varangian" origin story may need revision — Finnish/Baltic rather than Swedish?
2. VK157 may represent a Finnish/Baltic elite rather than Swedish royalty
3. The I-Y45113 → I-Y224059 lineage (APR/Andrzej) may have Finnish rather than Swedish deep ancestry

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain G25 coordinates for VK157 and compare with Swedish vs. Finnish reference populations
2. Analyze other Bodzia samples for Finnish vs. Swedish autosomal patterns
3. Compare VK157 with documented Swedish Viking-era samples from the Nature 2020 dataset
4. Review published literature on Finnish vs. Swedish genetic differentiation in the Viking era

**Expected Outcome:** Clarifies the geographic origin of VK157 and the broader I1-S2077 lineage.

### **RA.3: VK155-VK157 Autosomal Relationship — Emnilda of Lusatia Connection**
**Status:** Strongly Supported (January 2026 Facebook research)
**Confidence:** 85% (genetic data matches historical sources)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (strengthens VK157 = Svyatopolk identification)

**Discovery:** In-depth autosomal comparison between VK157 and VK155 (the female buried with him) reveals they are **close relatives**, consistent with historical sources describing Svyatopolk's wife as his half-aunt.

**Genetic Evidence:**

| Metric | VK157 ↔ VK155 | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Shared autosomal DNA | **122 cM** | 2nd cousins or closer |
| Shared mtDNA | **H1c** (both) | Common maternal ancestor |
| Burial context | Together in grave E864/I | Husband-wife burial |

**Historical Context — The Emnilda Connection:**

Historical sources suggest Svyatopolk's wife may have been his **half-aunt** through Emnilda of Lusatia:

```
                    Emnilda of Lusatia
                    (Piast princess)
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        │                  │                  │
   Daughter A         Daughter B          (other children)
   (→ married,       (= VK155, wife
    had children)     of Svyatopolk)
        │
   Svyatopolk's
     Mother
        │
   Svyatopolk
    (VK157)
```

**If Emnilda was both:**
- Svyatopolk's **maternal grandmother** (mother's mother), AND
- Svyatopolk's **mother-in-law** (wife's mother)

Then VK155 (the wife) would be Svyatopolk's mother's half-sister — his **half-aunt**.

**Why 122 cM is Consistent:**

| Relationship | Expected cM | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Half-aunt/nephew | 425-850 cM | Full theoretical range |
| 2nd cousins | 75-360 cM | Typical range |
| **Ancient DNA** | **Lower than expected** | Degradation, calling errors, fragment loss |

The 122 cM shared DNA is within the expected range for ancient DNA analysis of half-aunt/nephew or close cousin relationships, accounting for:
1. DNA degradation over ~1000 years
2. Sequencing coverage limitations
3. Segment fragmentation from damage
4. Potential endogamy effects in medieval royal families

**Corroborating Evidence:**

1. **Shared mtDNA H1c** — Confirms maternal line connection through Emnilda
2. **Burial together** — Consistent with husband-wife interpretation
3. **Elite burial at Bodzia (~1019 CE)** — Timing matches Svyatopolk's death
4. **Historical sources** — Document the half-aunt marriage specifically

**Impact on RA.1 (Y-DNA Mismatch):**

This evidence **strengthens** the NPE conclusion:

- **IF** VK157 is confirmed as Svyatopolk (RA.3 supports this), **THEN**:
- The Y-DNA mismatch with VK542/Gleb (I1-S2077 vs I2-Y4460) **must** reflect a non-paternity event
- Most likely in Vladimir's line (his mother Malusha was a slave/concubine)
- OR in Yaropolk's line (Svyatopolk was called "son of two fathers" by Vladimir's court)

**Evidence Sources:**
- Facebook group research (January 2026): VK157-VK155 autosomal comparison
- MTA Deep Dive analysis: VK157 → VK155: 41 SNP chains, 114.79 cM (earlier estimate)
- Updated comparison: 122 cM shared DNA (January 2026)
- Historical sources on Emnilda of Lusatia and Svyatopolk's marriage
- Project documentation: `docs/VK155_VK157_BURIAL_HYPOTHESIS.md`

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain primary publication data on VK155-VK157 autosomal comparison
2. Verify Emnilda genealogy in independent historical sources
3. Calculate expected cM ranges for half-aunt/nephew with ancient DNA degradation models
4. Cross-reference with other Bodzia samples for endogamy patterns
5. Seek independent confirmation of the 122 cM measurement

**Expected Outcome:**
- High confidence that VK157 = Svyatopolk I
- Confirms VK155 as his wife (and maternal relative through Emnilda)
- Strengthens the NPE conclusion in RA.1 — the Y-DNA mismatch with Gleb must reflect illegitimacy somewhere in the Rurikid line

---

### **RA.4: Ottonian Princess Theory — Svyatopolk's Mother's True Identity**
**Status:** Supported by Medieval Source (Genealogia Welforum 1125/26)
**Confidence:** 70% (documentary evidence present; requires further verification)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (impacts interpretation of VK157 genetic affinities and legitimacy claims)
**Cross-reference:** Strengthens RA.1 (NPE), RA.2 (Western autosomal affinity), RA.3 (Emnilda connection)

**Hypothesis:** Svyatopolk I's mother was NOT a "Greek nun" (as claimed by Yaroslav the Wise's court), but rather an **Ottonian princess** — the unnamed third daughter of Conrad (Kuno), Count of Swabia, and granddaughter of **Emperor Otto I**. This explains the strong Western European genetic affinities of VK157 and VK155.

**Primary Documentary Evidence — Genealogia Welforum (1125/26):**

The medieval genealogy *Genealogia Welforum* (with additions from *Historia Welforum* 1167/74) documents the family of Kuno and Richlint "von Öhningen" (Stammtafel 1, based on Reichenau Memorial records, 2nd half 10th century):

```
                    OTTO I, EMPEROR (912-973)
                           │
                     (Richlint) = [7] Richlint
                  "filia Ottonis Magni imperatoris"
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐

    Conrad (Kuno)     Other children    Other branches
    Count of Swabia
           │
    ┌──────┼──────┬─────────┬───────────┬────────────┐
    │      │      │         │           │            │
  Leopaldus  Liutoldus  Chuono   Ita       "tertia"     quarta
   = [4]     = [2]      = [3]   de Oningen  ∞ REGI    [Kunigunde]
 Herimannus Liutoldus Cuonradus = [5] Ita  RUGORUM   ∞ comiti
             laicus    laicus   ∞ Ruodolfus   [-]     de Andhese
                                               │
                                        "King of the Rus"
                                         = YAROPOLK I (?)
                                               │
                                        SVYATOPOLK I (VK157?)
```

**The Key Text:** *"tertia ∞ regi Rugorum"* — "the third [daughter] married the king of the Rugians/Rus"

**Interpretation of "Rugorum":**

| Interpretation | Meaning | Likelihood |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| **Rus** (Kievan Rus) | Prince/King of the Rus = Yaropolk I | **HIGH** — fits 10th c. political context |
| Rugi (Germanic tribe) | Archaic term, rarely used in 10th c. | LOW |
| Rügen (Baltic island) | Local rulers, less prominent | LOW |

**If "regi Rugorum" = Yaropolk I, then:**
- Svyatopolk's mother was a **granddaughter of Emperor Otto I**
- She was from the **Ottonian-Swabian** noble line
- This makes Svyatopolk of **imperial Germanic descent** on his maternal side

---

**The "Greek Nun" Propaganda — Yaroslav's Court Falsification:**

The narrative that Svyatopolk's mother was a "Greek nun captured by Svyatoslav" comes from sources sympathetic to **Yaroslav the Wise** (Vladimir's son), who had political motivations to delegitimize Svyatopolk:

| Claim | Source | Motivation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| "Greek nun" mother | Yaroslav's court chronicles | Delegitimize Svyatopolk |
| "Son of two fathers" | Vladimir's propaganda | Question Svyatopolk's paternity |
| "Svyatopolk the Accursed" | Yaroslav's hagiography | Vilify rival claimant |

**Why Yaroslav needed to delegitimize Svyatopolk:**
1. **Yaroslav descended from Malusha** — a slave/concubine, not a princess
2. **Svyatopolk was from the senior line** (Yaropolk → Svyatoslav → Rurik)
3. **If Svyatopolk's mother was Ottonian royalty**, his claim to the throne was **superior** to Yaroslav's
4. **Calling her a "Greek nun"** removes her noble status and legitimacy

**Propaganda Pattern:**
```
ACTUAL LINEAGE (per Genealogia Welforum):
Svyatopolk ← Yaropolk I ← Svyatoslav I ← Rurik
    ↑
 Mother = Ottonian princess (granddaughter of Otto I)

YAROSLAV'S PROPAGANDA VERSION:
Svyatopolk ← "son of two fathers" (legitimacy questioned)
    ↑
 Mother = "Greek nun" (no noble status)
```

---

**Genetic Corroboration — Western European Autosomal Affinity:**

If Svyatopolk's mother was an Ottonian princess, we would expect:

| Prediction | Evidence | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Western European maternal ancestry | VK157 + VK155 share mtDNA **H1c** | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| Close genetic relationship to Western nobility | VK157 shows non-Scandinavian autosomal clustering | ✅ SUPPORTED |
| VK155 (maternal relative) also Western-affiliated | VK155 shares 122 cM with VK157, same mtDNA | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| Elite burial with Western connections | Bodzia cemetery shows mixed Scandinavian/Western elite culture | ✅ CONFIRMED |

**Note on Finnish vs. Western Affinity (RA.2):**
The Nature 2020 paper reported VK157 clustering with "Finnish" populations. However:
- 10th-century population genetics were different from modern reference panels
- "Finnish" clustering may reflect Baltic/Northern European components present in both Finnish and Germanic populations
- The Ottonian hypothesis does not contradict Finnish affinity — it explains the **Western European** component

---

**The Bident Tamga Evidence — Senior Line Marker:**

Svyatopolk used the **bident (двузубец, two-pronged) tamga**, NOT the trident (трезубец):

| Tamga Type | Symbol | Line | Primary Users |
|------------|--------|------|---------------|
| **Bident** | ⚔ (two-pronged) | **Senior** (Yaropolk) | Svyatopolk I |
| **Trident** | 🔱 (three-pronged) | Junior (Vladimir) | Vladimir I, Yaroslav, descendants |

**Significance:**
- The bident was the **original Rurikid symbol** of the senior line
- Svyatopolk's use of the bident confirms his **legitimate descent from Yaropolk** (senior branch)
- Vladimir's line adopted the trident as their distinct marker
- This is **independent heraldic evidence** supporting Svyatopolk's legitimacy

**Source:** Beletsky S. V. (2009). "Еще раз о знаках Рюриковичей" (Once again about the signs of the Rurikids). *Proceedings of the State Hermitage*, Vol. XLIX, pp. 222-226.

---

**Integration with Other RA Hypotheses:**

| Hypothesis | How RA.4 Connects |
|------------|-------------------|
| **RA.1** (Y-DNA Mismatch) | If Svyatopolk's mother was Ottonian, this doesn't affect Y-DNA — the NPE remains in the MALE line (either Yaropolk or Vladimir was not Svyatoslav's biological son) |
| **RA.2** (Finnish/Western Affinity) | Ottonian maternal ancestry explains Western European autosomal components in VK157 |
| **RA.3** (Emnilda/VK155) | Emnilda of Lusatia may have been connected to the Ottonian-Piast network; VK155's Western mtDNA H1c fits this model |

---

**Evidence Sources:**
- *Genealogia Welforum* (1125/26) with additions from *Historia Welforum* (1167/74)
- Reichenau Memorial records (2nd half 10th century)
- Stammtafel 1: "Die Familie Kunos und Richlints 'von Öhningen'" (annotations by Armin Wolf)
- Beletsky S. V. (2009) on Rurikid tamgas
- LKP note (Sept. 4th, 2023): "Who really was the wife of Yaropolk Svyatoslavich G.D. of Kiev?"

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain full text of *Genealogia Welforum* passage on "regi Rugorum"
2. Cross-reference with other 10th-11th century sources mentioning Yaropolk's wife
3. Analyze whether "Rugorum" consistently refers to Rus in contemporary documents
4. Compare Ottonian princess timeline with Yaropolk I's marriage date
5. Verify Beletsky's tamga analysis with independent heraldic sources
6. Check if any Ottonian-era documents reference a marriage alliance with Kievan Rus

**Expected Outcome:**
- Strengthens VK157 = Svyatopolk identification through multiple independent lines of evidence
- Explains VK157's Western European genetic affinities
- Documents the propaganda campaign by Yaroslav's court
- Connects the genetic findings (RA.1-RA.3) to historical context
- Validates the bident tamga as evidence of senior-line legitimacy

### **RA.5: I1 European Elite Network — Von Plotho, Warenne, Hastings, Stanhope Connections**
**Status:** Strengthened by MTA Deep Dive Evidence (January 2026)
**Confidence:** 60% (up from 45%; LKP MTA Deep Dive matches + autosomal confirmation)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (direct genetic links to VK157 and I-S2077 lineage confirmed)
**Cross-reference:** Now directly connected to I-S2077 via VK157 matches (see RA.6 for tamga evidence)

**Hypothesis:** Multiple European noble families (von Plotho of Brandenburg, Warenne, Stanhope) and modern Erzya/Mordwin populations share haplogroup **I-Z63** or closely related subclades, suggesting a common ancestor in the early medieval period (~800-1000 CE) and wide geographic dispersal of an elite male lineage.

**Background — I-Z63 in the I1 Phylogeny:**

```
I-M253 (I1)
    │
    ├── I-Z63 (major subclade)
    │      │
    │      ├── Various downstream branches
    │      │      │
    │      │      ├── Von Plotho (Brandenburg)?
    │      │      ├── Warenne (England)?
    │      │      ├── Stanhope (England)?
    │      │      └── Erzya/Mordwin (Volga region)?
    │      │
    │      └── (other branches)
    │
    └── I-S2077 (separate branch — VK157/APR lineage)
           │
           └── I-Y45113 → I-Y224059 (Andrzej Radzimowski)
```

**Note:** I-Z63 and I-S2077 are **distinct branches** under I1. They share a common ancestor thousands of years ago but are NOT the same lineage. This hypothesis tracks I-Z63 separately from the main APR research focus (I-S2077 → I-Y45113).

---

**Documented I-Z63 Connections:**

| Family/Group | Location | Time Period | I-Z63 Status | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **Von Plotho** | Brandenburg, Germany | Documented from ~946 CE | Confirmed I-Z63 | Genealogy traced to Otto II era; Hermann I von Plotho (12th c.) |
| **Warenne** | England (Surrey, Sussex) | Post-1066 Norman | Reported on I-Z63 branch | William de Warenne I (d. 1088); Westminster Abbey burials |
| **Stanhope** | England | Medieval-modern | Reported on I-Z63 branch | Baronial family; Westminster Abbey burials |
| **Erzya/Mordwin** | Volga region, Russia | Modern population | I-Z63 matches reported | ~12% I1 in some Erzya samples (FTDNA project data) |

---

**Von Plotho — Primary Case Study:**

The **Freiherren von Plotho** are a Brandenburg noble family with documented history from the 10th century:

**Historical Documentation:**
- First documented: ~946 CE (Brandenburg region)
- Continuous male-line genealogy claimed from Hermann I von Plotho (12th century)
- Family crypts reportedly intact (not destroyed during WWII/Soviet era)
- Extensive family documentation available

**Y-DNA Status:**
- At least one male-line von Plotho tested as **I-Z63** (confirmed)
- Reported to be on the same sub-branch as Warenne/Stanhope
- Individual has been "inactive" in genetic genealogy discussions since ~2007
- Reported Y-STR matches to:
  - Polish/Eastern European lineages
  - **Erzya/Mordwin** individuals (Finno-Ugric population)

**Potential Research Opportunity:**
- Von Plotho family crypts reportedly survive
- Testing ancestral remains could verify multi-generational patrilineal continuity
- Would provide exceptional data point: documented noble genealogy + ancient DNA + modern DNA

---

**Why Erzya/Mordwin Matches Are NOT "Contradictory":**

The presence of I-Z63 (or I1 subclades generally) in both:
1. Western European nobility (von Plotho, Warenne, Stanhope)
2. Volga-Uralic populations (Erzya/Mordwin)

...is **historically plausible**, not contradictory:

| Explanation | Mechanism | Timeframe |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Viking-era trade routes** | Varangian route: Scandinavia → Baltic → Volga → Caspian | 800-1100 CE |
| **Early medieval migrations** | Germanic/Scandinavian expansion eastward | 500-1000 CE |
| **Shared deep ancestry** | Common I1 ancestor before regional differentiation | 2000-4000 BP |
| **Elite network dispersal** | Marriage alliances, military service, colonization | 800-1200 CE |

**Erzya/Mordwin Y-DNA Context:**
- FTDNA Erzya-Moksha DNA Project reports ~12% I1 in some samples
- I1 presence in Volga-Uralic populations is documented, not anomalous
- Does NOT indicate "Soviet soldier" ancestry (common misunderstanding)

---

**The "Hiding Since 2007" Phenomenon:**

A von Plotho family member reportedly:
- Tested Y-DNA showing I-Z63
- Had STR matches to Polish lineages and Erzya/Mordwin individuals
- Became inactive in genetic genealogy discussions (~2007)
- Reportedly resistant to discussing Y-DNA results

**Possible reasons for reluctance:**
1. **Ethnic identity conflict** — Matches to "Mordwins" may conflict with Germanic self-image
2. **Paper genealogy concerns** — DNA results may complicate documented ancestry claims
3. **Privacy preference** — Aristocratic families often prefer discretion
4. **Misunderstanding** — May incorrectly interpret Erzya matches as "non-European" ancestry

**Outreach attempts:**
- Contact attempted through Marek Skarbek Kozietulski (unsuccessful)
- Further contact recommended through neutral genealogical channels

---

**Warenne and Stanhope — Westminster Abbey Connection:**

Both families have members buried in **Westminster Abbey**, indicating high status in English medieval/early modern society:

**Warenne (de Warenne / Warren):**
- Anglo-Norman family arriving with William the Conqueror (1066)
- William de Warenne I (c. 1020-1088) — companion of William the Conqueror, 4th richest man in England post-1066
- Major landholders in Surrey, Sussex; Earls of Surrey
- Male line extinct by 14th century
- **Y-DNA: I1-S10360** (confirmed via MTA Deep Dive, January 2026 — LKP correspondence)
- **MTA Deep Dive Match to VK157** — de Warenne sample matches Bodzia elite male
- **Autosomal match** to LKP confirmed (same MTA Deep Dive analysis)
- Castle Acre (Norfolk) survives as ruins from post-1066 construction

**Sharon Bennett Connolly Research (May 2021):**
- William de Warenne's mother Beatrix was likely a niece of **Duchess Gunnor** (wife of Duke Richard I of Normandy)
- This makes William de Warenne a **second cousin once removed of William the Conqueror**
- Gunnor was the mother of **Emma of Normandy** (wife of both Æthelred II and King Cnut)
- Connection confirmed by Archbishop Anselm forbidding a marriage on grounds of **consanguinity**
- Family name derives from hamlet of Varenne, south of Arques, Normandy (Seine-Inférieure)

**Norman/Viking Ancestry:**
- "Given that the family hailed from Normandy, it is likely that they had Scandinavian ancestry, just like the majority of Normans, including their duke, William"
- Duke William descended from **Rollo**, the first Norse/Viking ruler of Normandy
- This establishes a genetic link between VK157 (Bodzia) → de Warenne → Rollo/Norman dynasty

**Hastings:**
- Anglo-Norman baronial family
- **Y-DNA: I1-Y24790** (confirmed via MTA Deep Dive, January 2026 — LKP correspondence)
- **MTA Deep Dive Match to VK157** — Hastings sample matches Bodzia elite male
- **Autosomal match** to LKP confirmed (same MTA Deep Dive analysis)
- Strengthens the VK157 → Western European elite network hypothesis

**Stanhope:**
- English baronial family
- Multiple members buried in Westminster Abbey
- Potential genealogical connection to Warenne (through marriage or common ancestry)
- Y-DNA reported on I-Z63 branch (requires verification)

---

**Verification Requirements:**

To confirm the I-Z63 elite network hypothesis:

| Step | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Obtain terminal SNP for von Plotho individual | Needed |
| 2 | Verify Warenne/Stanhope Y-DNA with SNP testing | Needed |
| 3 | Place all on YFull/FTDNA tree with precise branching | Needed |
| 4 | Compare with Erzya/Mordwin I-Z63 samples | Needed |
| 5 | (Optional) Test von Plotho ancestral remains | Possible if crypts accessible |

**Key Questions:**
1. Are von Plotho, Warenne, and Stanhope on the **same** I-Z63 sub-branch?
2. What is the TMRCA between these families?
3. Do Erzya I-Z63 samples share the same downstream SNPs?
4. Can ancient DNA from von Plotho crypts verify patrilineal continuity?

---

**Evidence Sources:**
- Von Plotho family documentation (available)
- FTDNA Erzya-Moksha DNA Project (12% I1 in some samples)
- Westminster Abbey burial records (Warenne, Stanhope)
- Email correspondence mentioning Marek Skarbek Kozietulski outreach attempt
- [Wikipedia: Von Plotho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Plotho)
- [Wikipedia: House of Warenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Warenne)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Contact von Plotho individual through neutral channels for terminal SNP sharing
2. Identify Warenne/Stanhope descendants willing to test or share existing results
3. Request I-Z63 branch placement from FTDNA I1 project administrators
4. Compare terminal SNPs with Erzya/Mordwin I-Z63 samples in public databases
5. If successful: Document as example of medieval elite Y-DNA dispersal across Europe

**Expected Outcome:**
- If confirmed: Documents remarkable case of I-Z63 dispersal from Germany to England to Volga region
- Provides comparative context for understanding I1 subclade distributions in medieval elite networks
- May reveal connections between Central European and Eastern European noble families
- Directly supports the I-S2077 → I-Y45113 research through VK157 matches to de Warenne and Hastings
- Suggests VK157 (and by extension the APR lineage) may connect to the broader Norman/Viking elite network via Rollo

### **RA.6: VK157 Belt Fitting Tamga — Senior Rurikid Line Evidence (LKP Expert Analysis)**
**Status:** Strongly Supported (50+ years tamga research; Pskov burial parallel)
**Confidence:** 85% (expert analysis + archaeological parallel + heraldic context)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (eliminates "mercenary" interpretation; confirms elite dynastic status)
**Cross-reference:** Strengthens RA.1 (NPE), RA.3 (Emnilda), RA.4 (Ottonian Princess), RA.5 (Anglo-Norman matches)

**Expert Source:** LKP correspondence (January 21, 2026) — 50+ years of tamga research, specializing in Indo-Iranian ownership marks and Polish proto-heraldry.

---

**The Tamga Evidence — What the Belt Fitting Proves:**

The VK157 burial at Bodzia includes a **belt fitting with a bident (two-pronged) tamga**. LKP's analysis establishes that:

| Claim | Evidence | Implication |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Tamgas were **personal/dynastic marks** | Sarmatian → Alanic → Khazar → Rurikid adoption chain | Not decorative — indicates lineage membership |
| Belt fittings with tamgas = **elite status** | Bosporan Kingdom examples (e.g., Tiberius Julius Eupator, 153-174 CE) | Only rulers/royal family wore belt-marked tamgas |
| Scandinavians did NOT use belt tamgas | No Scandinavian belt fittings with tamgas found anywhere | The practice came from steppe/Sarmatian tradition |
| Only **lineage members** could wear family tamgas | Deviation required permission; outsiders prohibited | VK157 cannot be a "mere mercenary" |

**Key Quote (LKP):**
> "Żaden tam hetka-pętelka, jakiś giermek czy gwardzista sarmackiego króla nie miał prawa nosić takiego pasa z królewskim znakiem, jeśli nie był z jego rodu"
> ("No hanger-on, no squire or guard of a Sarmatian king had the right to wear such a belt with a royal mark unless he was of his family")

---

**The Bident vs. Trident Distinction:**

| Symbol | Line | Primary Users | Significance |
|--------|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Bident** (двузубец) | **SENIOR** (Yaropolk → Svyatopolk) | Svyatopolk I | Original Rurikid symbol |
| **Trident** (трезубец) | **JUNIOR** (Vladimir → Yaroslav) | Vladimir I and descendants | Modified by adding "key" (for Malusha) |

**VK157's belt fitting shows a bident** — this is the mark of the **senior Rurikid line** (Yaropolk's branch), not Vladimir's junior line.

**LKP's interpretation of the belt fitting symbol:**
- Polish archaeologists sometimes describe it as "Thor's hammer" or "sword"
- LKP: *"Skuwki nie wykonywał snycerz, tylko rymarz, a ten miał na pewno pokazany rysunek"* ("The fitting was made by a leatherworker, not a sculptor, who was shown a drawing")
- The two-pronged form is consistent with the **bident tamga**, not Norse symbolism

---

**The Pskov Burial Parallel (2007 Discovery):**

A crucial archaeological parallel was discovered in Pskov, Russia in 2007 — a Varangian dignitary buried with a **Rurikid bident tamga pendant**:

**Key Facts:**
- **Date:** Discovered 2007, published 2008 (Pskovskaya Gubernia newspaper, No. 409, Oct 8-14, 2008)
- **Burial type:** Elite Varangian chamber grave with rich artifacts
- **Tamga:** Silver trapezoidal pendant with **bident (двузубец)** — the SENIOR Rurikid symbol
- **Reverse side:** Falcon with cross on head — identified as **Княгиня Ольга's mark** (Princess Olga of Pskov)
- **Desecration:** Grave was opened ~20 years after burial, skull smashed, then reburied with artifacts intact

**Interpretation (Pskov archaeologists):**
- The bident with "key" symbol inside = **Vladimir's personal tamga** (the key represents his mother Malusha the keykeeper)
- The bearer was Vladimir's **наместник (namestnik/representative)** in Pskov
- Dating: 969-977 CE (Vladimir was Prince of Novgorod, which included Pskov)
- The grave desecration = **revenge** during the Yaropolk-Vladimir power struggle (977-980 CE)

**Why This Matters for VK157:**
1. **Only TWO bident tamga finds exist** — Pskov pendant and VK157 belt fitting
2. Both indicate **senior Rurikid line membership**
3. The Pskov namestnik was murdered/desecrated for bearing Yaropolk's/Vladimir's early mark
4. VK157's belt fitting with bident = same status level (NOT a common warrior)

**Russian Source Quote:**
> "Ученые не сомневаются: это не что иное, как тамга Рюриковичей — нечто вроде «удостоверения личности» представителя князя"
> ("Scientists have no doubt: this is none other than a Rurikid tamga — something like an 'identity card' of the prince's representative")

---

**No Rurikid Tamga Belt Fittings Found in Core Rus' Territory:**

LKP emphasizes a critical negative finding:

> "Nie znaleziono ani na Kijowszczyznie Rurykowiczów ani w Nowgorodzie Wielkim pochówków ze znakiem jakiegokolwiek (!!!) Rurykowicza na okuciu pasa ani na Rurikowym Gorodyszczu, ani w Gniezdowie, ani w ogóle nigdzie."

Translation: "Neither in Rurikid Kiev nor in Great Novgorod have ANY burials been found with any Rurikid mark on a belt fitting — not at Rurikovo Gorodishche, not at Gnezdovo, not anywhere."

**Implication:** The VK157 belt fitting is **exceptional** — it's the ONLY Rurikid-era belt fitting with a bident tamga found in a burial context. This alone proves VK157 was not an ordinary warrior.

---

**Sarmatian Belt Tamga Tradition — Historical Context:**

LKP provides deep historical background on belt-mounted tamgas:

| Period | Culture | Practice | Reference |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 2nd-4th c. CE | Sarmatians (Bosporan Kingdom) | Belt end-caps marked with owner's tamga | Sulimirski, *The Sarmatians* (1970) |
| 2nd c. CE | Tiberius Julius Eupator (Bosporan king) | Royal belt with personal tamga + maternal clan mark | Lebedynsky, *Les tamgas* |
| 5th-8th c. CE | Alans, Vandals, Thuringians | Tamga tradition carried through migrations | Wide dispersal evidence |
| 6th-9th c. CE | Khazars | Adopted tamga tradition from Sarmatian contact | Steppe continuity |
| 9th-11th c. CE | Rurikids | Inherited tamga tradition via Khazar/steppe contact | Applied to pendants, coins, bricks, belt fittings |

**Dual Tamga System:**
Among Sarmatians, a ruler wore:
1. **Father's clan mark** (primary)
2. **Mother's clan mark** (secondary)

This may explain the reverse markings on the Pskov pendant (bident + Olga's falcon).

---

**Impact on Project Hypotheses:**

| Hypothesis | How RA.6 Strengthens It |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **RA.1** (Y-DNA Mismatch) | If VK157 wore the SENIOR LINE bident, the NPE must be in Vladimir's JUNIOR line |
| **RA.3** (Emnilda Connection) | Elite dynastic marriage context — only a Rurikid prince would marry Emnilda's daughter |
| **RA.4** (Ottonian Princess) | Ottonian mother + bident = legitimate senior-line prince (Svyatopolk) |
| **RA.5** (Anglo-Norman Network) | de Warenne/Hastings matches to VK157 connect Norman/Rollo lineage to Rurikids |

**Conclusion (LKP):**
> "Ten elitarny wojownik z Bodzi nie mógł być jakimś najemnikiem. Należał do starszej linii Rurykowiczów i dlatego mógł sobie nosić na pasie znak dwuzębny."
> ("This elite warrior from Bodzia could not have been some mercenary. He belonged to the senior Rurikid line and therefore could wear the bident mark on his belt.")

- Sharon Bennett Connolly (2021). "The Origins of the Warenne Family" — historytheinterestingbits.com

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain high-resolution images of VK157 belt fitting for independent symbol analysis
2. Compare with published Rurikid coin tamgas (Svyatopolk's bident + cross)
3. Cross-reference Pskov burial publication (2007-2008) for full archaeological context
4. Consult with other tamga specialists (Lebedynsky, Beletsky) if possible
5. Document the "no belt tamgas in core Rus'" negative finding independently

**Expected Outcome:**
- Definitively rules out "mercenary/commoner" interpretation of VK157
- Confirms VK157 as a member of the SENIOR Rurikid line
- Combined with RA.3 (Emnilda) and RA.4 (Ottonian), strongly supports VK157 = Svyatopolk I
- The bident vs. trident distinction explains the Y-DNA mismatch (RA.1) — NPE in Vladimir's junior line

### **RA.7: Rollo/Norman Dynasty Connection — VK157 to Western European Elite Network**
**Status:** Supported (MTA Deep Dive matches + genealogical documentation)
**Confidence:** 55% (multiple independent genetic matches; genealogical links documented)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (connects Bodzia burial to broader European elite dispersal)
**Cross-reference:** RA.5 (de Warenne/Hastings), RA.6 (tamga evidence)

**Hypothesis:** VK157 (Bodzia elite male, proposed Svyatopolk I) shares genetic connections with Anglo-Norman families (de Warenne, Hastings) who trace ancestry to **Rollo** (c. 860-930 CE), the first ruler of Normandy. This suggests a common Viking/Scandinavian elite ancestor population.

**The Connection Chain:**

```

**Genetic Evidence (MTA Deep Dive, January 2026):**

| Family | Y-Haplogroup | MTA Match to VK157 | Autosomal Match (LKP) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **de Warenne** | I1-S10360 | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| **Hastings** | I1-Y24790 | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |

**Genealogical Documentation:**
- de Warenne: William I's mother Beatrix was niece of Duchess Gunnor (Richard I's wife)
- Gunnor was mother of Emma of Normandy (wife of Æthelred II and Cnut)
- Rollo ancestry confirmed for Norman ducal line

**LKP Interpretation:**
> "Ten związek kilku naszych genetycznych 'kuzynów' po mieczu z diukami Normandii po Rollonie też mnie nie dziwi."
> ("This connection of several of our genetic 'cousins' through the sword line with the Dukes of Normandy after Rollo doesn't surprise me either.")

**Implication for VK157:**
If VK157 (I1-S2077) matches de Warenne (I1-S10360) and Hastings (I1-Y24790) in MTA Deep Dive:
- All three may share a common Viking-era ancestor
- The ancestor population was part of the **9th-10th century Scandinavian elite dispersal**
- This elite network spread to:
  - **Normandy** (Rollo → de Warenne, Hastings)
  - **Kievan Rus'** (Rurikids → VK157/Svyatopolk)
  - **England** (post-1066 Norman conquest)

**Broader European Perspective (LKP):**
> "Na Bodzię należy spojrzeć z szerszej europejskiej perspektywy późnej epoki Wikingów."
> ("Bodzia should be viewed from a broader European perspective of the late Viking Age.")

Suggested additional comparisons:
- **Winchester Cathedral** ancient DNA studies
- **Sweyn Estridsen** (Roskilde, Denmark) — Danish king, potential comparative sample
- **VK155** (the woman buried with VK157) — "nie mówiąc o zapomnianej dziewczynie z grobu faceta VK157"

**Evidence Sources:**
- LKP correspondence (January 21, 2026)
- MTA Deep Dive analysis: de Warenne (I1-S10360), Hastings (I1-Y24790)
- Sharon Bennett Connolly (2021). "The Origins of the Warenne Family"
- [Wikipedia: House of Warenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Warenne)
- [Wikipedia: Rollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollo)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Obtain SNP-level comparison between VK157 (I1-S2077), de Warenne (I1-S10360), Hastings (I1-Y24790)
2. Calculate TMRCA between these I1 subclades
3. Seek additional Norman/Viking-era ancient DNA for comparison
4. Contact Sharon Bennett Connolly for potential genealogical collaboration
5. Investigate Winchester Cathedral and Sweyn Estridsen DNA studies

**Expected Outcome:**
- Confirms VK157's placement within the broader Viking-era elite genetic network
- Documents the dispersal of related I1 lineages across Normandy, England, and Kievan Rus'
- Provides additional context for the APR (I-Y45113) lineage's medieval elite connections

## TIER 2: HERALDIC & SURNAME HYPOTHESES

### **H2.1: Grzymała Heraldic Clan Connection**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 45%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Radzimowski, Garboś, and Mazgaj families may have belonged to the Grzymała heraldic clan (h. Grzymała), representing sept families that split regionally between 1500-1800 CE.

**Evidence Required:**
- Heraldic records showing Garboś and Mazgaj using Grzymała arms
- Documented Radzimowski h. Grzymała (1552, Radzimowic, Płock)
- Cross-references in armorials (Boniecki, Uruski, Niesiecki)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Search Boniecki's *Herbarz Polski* for Garboś and Mazgaj entries
2. Check Uruski's *Rodzina* genealogies
3. Review Niesiecki's *Herbarz Polski* (18th century)
4. Search Polish State Archives for noble registers

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms heraldic brotherhood, independent of Y-DNA.

---

### **H2.2: Surname Adoption from Place Names**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 40%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** The surnames Radzimowski, Garboś, and Mazgaj may reflect place names or land holdings, but the timing and mechanism (including Austrian reforms) are unproven.

**Evidence Required:**
- Pre-1750 usage of these surnames in parish records
- Place names: Radzimowice (for Radzimowski), Garbosze/Garbów (for Garboś), Mazgaje/Mazgajka (for Mazgaj)
- Patronymic patterns in early records

**Verification Steps:**
1. Search parish records before 1750 for surname usage
2. Identify place names matching surnames
3. Check for patronymic patterns (e.g., "Jan son of Piotr Radzimowski")
4. Analyze Austrian cadastral records (1820s-1850s)

**Expected Outcome:** Clarifies surname origin and adoption timeline.

## TIER 3: GEOGRAPHIC MIGRATION HYPOTHESES

### **H3.1: Migration from Płock Region to Podkarpackie**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 40%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** The Radzimowski family may have migrated from the Płock region (Mazovia) to Baranów Sandomierski (Podkarpackie) between 1550-1700 CE.

**Evidence Required:**
- Radzimowski records in Płock region (1550-1700)
- Settlement records in Baranów Sandomierski (1650-1750)
- Land grants or noble privileges documenting migration

**Verification Steps:**
1. Search Płock archival records (1550-1700)
2. Check Baranów Sandomierski settlement lists
3. Review land records (księgi ziemskie)
4. Analyze migration patterns during historical conflicts

**Expected Outcome:** Documents migration pathway and timing.

---

### **H3.2: Podkarpackie Regional Cluster**
**Status:** Partially Supported
**Confidence:** 70% (up from 60%; Mazgaj location independently confirmed)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Radzimowski, Garboś, and Mazgaj families formed a geographic cluster in Podkarpackie (within ~45 km) during 1700-1850 CE, suggesting local social ties. This supports proximity, not direct kinship by itself.

**Evidence Present (January 2026 Update):**
- **Jadwiga Tolk confirmation:** Mazgaj family documented in Sokołów Małopolski, 1800-1850; connected to pottery craft (garncarstwo)
- Geographic locations: Baranów Sandomierski (Radzimowski), Jadachy (Garboś), **Sokołów Małopolski (Mazgaj — confirmed)**
- Jadwiga's genealogical research traces Mazgaj roots to early 19th century in this region

**Evidence Required:**
- Parish records showing intermarriages
- Shared godparents and witnesses
- Cadastral records showing adjacent land holdings
- Potter guild records from Sokołów Małopolski (may identify Mazgaj family members)

**Verification Steps:**
1. ~~Map all three families' locations (1700-1850)~~ — Mazgaj location confirmed
2. Search parish records for cross-marriages
3. Analyze godparent networks
4. Review Austrian cadastral records for land patterns
5. **NEW:** Search Sokołów Małopolski potter guild/craft records (1800-1850)

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms local network and social connections.

---

### **H3.3: Berezhnoy = Ukrainian Migration Branch**
**Status:** Pending Verification — **Narrative Questioned**
**Confidence:** 25% (down from 35%; Aleksei's Polish fluency is self-taught, NOT family-transmitted; removes key supporting evidence)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Aleksei Berezhnoy is confirmed I-Y45233 (YFull (YTree database); Ukrainian origin in matches), and his ancestors may include a Polish branch that migrated to Ukraine in the 19th century and adopted the Ukrainian surname "Berezhnoy." Documentary evidence is still required.

**⚠️ January 2026 Update — Narrative Complication:**
Ukrainian Wikipedia documents multiple notable Radzimovsky (Радзимовський) families in Ukraine who **retained the Radzimowski surname** rather than adopting Ukrainian names:
- Віталій Іванович Радзимовський (1905-1975) — engineer/scientist, Ukraine → USA
- Дмитро Олександрович Радзимовський (1903-1985) — hydrobiologist, Kyiv
- Радзимовський — court judge in Kyiv, 1917-1918
- Іоанн Радзимовський — protopriest, Zvenyhorodka, Cherkasy region
- Петро Едуардович Радзимовський — teacher, Romny, Poltava region
- Броніслав Казимирович Радзимовський — information security specialist, Odesa

**Implication:** If other Radzimowskys in Ukraine kept their surname for generations, why would Aleksei's ancestors have adopted "Berezhnoy"? This suggests:
1. The Berezhnoy line may have **always been separate** from Radzimowski within I-Y45113
2. The lineage may have been present in **both Poland and Ukraine** since medieval times
3. The "Poland → Ukraine migration" narrative may be **oversimplified**

**Evidence Present (Circumstantial):**
- ~~Aleksei notes: "As you know, I can read Polish without asking google to translate unknown words"~~ — **CORRECTION (January 2026):** Aleksei learned Polish by himself; his parents did NOT speak Polish. This is **NOT evidence of Polish family origins**.
- Wladyslaw's maternal ancestor "Anastasia Sheszcuk" has "Ukrainian by origin" names (Aleksei's observation)
- I-Y45113 matches are predominantly Polish (but see H6.1 for Ukrainian Radzimovsky testing opportunity)

**Evidence NO LONGER Supporting Migration:**
- Aleksei's Polish fluency — self-taught, not family transmission

**Alternative Interpretations:**
1. **Dual-Origin Model:** I-Y45113 spread across Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with branches in both Poland and Ukraine since medieval period
2. **Deeper Common Ancestor:** The Berezhnoy and Radzimowski lines diverged centuries earlier, not in the 19th century
3. **Continuous Ukrainian Presence:** Aleksei's line may have always been Ukrainian, never using "Radzimowski"

**Evidence Required:**
- Berezhnoy family history indicating Polish origins beyond YFull country labels (from YTree sample metadata)
- Migration records from Poland to Ukraine (1800-1900) — **if they exist**
- Ukrainian archival records showing surname adoption — **or evidence of continuous "Berezhnoy" usage**
- Autosomal DNA showing elevated Polish ancestry
- **Y-DNA testing of Ukrainian Radzimovsky male-line descendants** (see H6.1)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Interview Aleksei about family history and oral traditions — **does he consider his family always Ukrainian or migrants from Poland?**
2. Search Ukrainian archives for "Berezhnoy" first appearance in his family's village
3. Check for Polish-origin families with similar Y-DNA in Ukraine
4. Analyze autosomal DNA for Polish admixture
5. **Cross-reference with H6.1** — if Ukrainian Radzimovskys test as I-Y45113, the migration narrative requires revision

**Expected Outcome:** Either documents migration to Ukraine and surname change, **OR** reveals that the lineage was present in both regions since medieval times.

### **H3.4: Skory Second Ukrainian Migration Branch**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 75% (conditional on Big Y-700 confirmation)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** Douglas Skory represents a distinct Poland → Ukraine → USA migration branch that is phylogenetically linked to the Radzimowski-Garboś-Mazgaj-Berezhnoy cluster under I-Y45113. This is the second documented Ukrainian migration branch (after Berezhnoy in H3.3), with potential Radzimowski collateral lines as a third pattern.

**Evidence Required:**
- Big Y-700 confirmation and haplogroup placement (H0.1)
- Documentary evidence for Trzemeszno → Ukraine → USA migration path

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm Big Y-700 status and haplogroup placement
2. Collect parish/immigration records (Trzemeszno, Ukraine, Ellis Island)
3. Add Doug’s SNP data to TMRCA calculations (H5.3)

**Expected Outcome:** Establishes a second documented Ukrainian migration branch (alongside Berezhnoy) and strengthens diaspora pattern evidence. Together with potential Radzimowski collateral lines, this supports H3.5 (Three Parallel Ukraine Migration Branches).

---

### **H3.5: Three Parallel Ukraine Migration Branches**
**Status:** Emerging Pattern  
**Confidence:** 70% (dependent on H3.4 confirmation)  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Berezhnoy, Skory, and potential Radzimowski collateral lines reflect parallel 19th-century Poland → Ukraine migration pathways within the I-Y45113 lineage.

**Evidence Required:**
- H3.3 and H3.4 confirmation
- Independent archival evidence for each branch

**Verification Steps:**
1. Complete H3.3 and H3.4 validation
2. Compare timelines and migration drivers (uprisings, colonization, economics)
3. Document shared patterns across branches

**Expected Outcome:** A coherent, multi-branch Ukraine migration model.

---

### **H3.6: Trzemeszno → Grand Rapids Settlement Link (Skory Context)**
**Status:** Partially Supported  
**Confidence:** 60%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Published community history indicates Trzemeszno was a major source of Polish emigrants to Grand Rapids (1855-1900), aligning with the Skory line’s reported Trzemeszno origin and Grand Rapids settlement.

**Evidence Present (Verified Geography + Historical Context):**
- Trzemeszno (town) is in Gniezno County, Greater Poland Voivodeship (west-central Poland), with coordinates ~52.567°N, 17.817°E.  
- Gmina Trzemeszno is ~64 km east of Poznań and ~16 km east of Gniezno.  
- Official municipal history notes Trzemeszno was under Prussian partition in 1793–1918 (zabór pruski), consistent with the emigration‑pressure narrative.

**Evidence Present (User-Provided; Not Yet Verified):**
- History Grand Rapids Historical Commission photo essay “A Tale of Two Cities: Trzemeszno & Grand Rapids” (Maciej Adamski & Diana Barrett, Nov 23, 2010) describes Trzemeszno migrants to Grand Rapids, early settlers from the town, and St. Adalbert’s parish as a key institutional anchor. (Independent verification pending.)

**Evidence Required:**
- Independent access to the History Grand Rapids photo essay for full citation
- Confirmation via primary sources (Grand Rapids Public Library microfilm; parish archives)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Capture full citation for the History Grand Rapids photo essay
2. Search Grand Rapids Public Library microfilm for “Echo” newspaper references to Skory (1900-1920)
3. Request St. Adalbert parish records for Skory baptisms/marriages/burials (1880-1920)

**Expected Outcome:** Documentary support for the Trzemeszno → Grand Rapids link and better context for Skory migration timing.

### **H3.7: Northern Pomeranian Radzimowski Cluster (Tczew/Kociewie)**
**Status:** Partially Supported  
**Confidence:** 55%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** A distinct Radzimowski cluster exists in northern Poland (Pomeranian Voivodeship, Tczew County area), separate from the Podkarpackie cluster and potentially reflecting an independent lineage or an earlier regional branch.

**Evidence Present (Verified Geography):**
- Piaseczno is a village in Gmina Gniew, Tczew County, Pomeranian Voivodeship.  
- Gmina Gniew lies in Tczew County and Pomeranian Voivodeship (official municipal data).  
- Gmina Morzeszczyn (Pomeranian Voivodeship) includes sołectwa Dzierżążno and Nowa Cerkiew (official municipal data).

**Evidence Present (User-Provided Screenshots; Verification Pending):**
- Geneteka search results for region “pomorskie” with surname Radzimowski show entries across Piaseczno, Gniew, Dzierżążno, Nowa Cerkiew, Sztum, Pelplin, Wielki Garc, and Wielkie Walichnowy (1653–1934).

**Evidence Required:**
- Direct verification of Geneteka entries via links/exports (screenshots captured)
- Parish register copies from Pelplin Diocese for the listed localities
- Any documented link between the northern cluster and Podkarpackie/Trzemeszno lines

**Verification Steps:**
1. Export Geneteka entries for Radzimowski in Tczew County area (Piaseczno, Gniew, Dzierżążno, Nowa Cerkiew)
2. Pull parish register scans for earliest occurrences (Pelplin Diocese archives)
3. Map earliest Radzimowski households and identify recurring parents/witnesses
4. Seek Y-DNA test from a confirmed male-line descendant of the northern cluster

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms whether the northern Pomeranian cluster is independent or connected to the Podkarpackie/Skory lines.

## TIER 5: GENETIC VERIFICATION HYPOTHESES

### **H5.1: Autosomal DNA Match with Bodzia**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 20%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Autosomal DNA may show weak affinity to Bodzia cemetery samples, but low-SNP-count matches alone are not evidence of direct descent.

**Evidence Required:**
- High-resolution autosomal results with segment-level data
- Replicable matches across platforms or independent datasets
- Clear documentation of match quality thresholds

**Verification Steps:**
1. Upload autosomal DNA to MyTrueAncestry.com (exploratory only)
2. Record match strength and SNP counts
3. Seek independent segment-level validation

**Expected Outcome:** Possible affinity signal; not proof of a direct Bodzia line.

### **H5.2: Autosomal DNA Match with Kievan Rus'**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 25%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Autosomal DNA may show weak affinity to Rus' period samples, but low-SNP-count matches are not sufficient to confirm direct ancestry.

**Evidence Required:**
- High-resolution autosomal results with segment-level data
- Independent replication of matches
- Clear documentation of sample quality and coverage

**Verification Steps:**
1. Treat existing MyTrueAncestry matches as exploratory
2. Analyze additional Rus' period samples with better coverage
3. Compare results with multiple carriers of I-Y45113 sub-branches

**Expected Outcome:** Possible regional affinity; not confirmation of elite ancestry.

---

### **H5.3: Y-DNA TMRCA (Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor) Calculation**
**Status:** Partially Supported (clean Y-STR data now available; Doug excluded until Big Y completed)  
**Confidence:** 68% (up from 55%; clean Y-STR distance data available; YFull age refinement confirmed)  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT

**Hypothesis:** With comparable Y-STR or SNP data from the four core individuals (Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw), a TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) estimate can be calculated. Doug Skory can be added as a fifth comparator once Big Y-700 is confirmed (H0.1). Method confidence is high, but date precision is moderate due to partial STR coverage, so YFull STR distances (from YTree analysis) and YFull branch TMRCA estimates are the best available proxies.

**Evidence Present (January 2026 Update):**
- Aleksei confirms clean Y-STR distances: Wladyslaw (4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei); Doug Skory (2/25, 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei)
- YFull age refinement confirmed: I-Y224059 TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) ~700 ybp (years before present; Aleksei notes: "I did not know that YFull decreased the age of our branch to 700 years")
- Doug Skory Big Y-700 NOT completed (H0.1); excluded from calculations until completed

**Evidence Required:**
- Consistent Y-STR panels (Y37/Y67/Y111) for all four individuals, or Big Y/YFull (comprehensive Y-DNA test; YFull analyzes BAM/VCF files) results
- Wladyslaw terminal SNP (Terminal Hg) placement (YFull upload (BAM or VCF file) recommended by Aleksei)
- Doug Skory Big Y-700 completion (H0.1)
- Cleaned STR calls (resolve `?` entries; reduce `n/a` gaps)
- Documented mutation rate assumptions and comparison method

**Verification Steps:**
1. Use YFull STR distances (from YTree analysis) as interim estimates (e.g., YF089989 7/462; YF003943 15/431)
2. Obtain full STR panels or Big Y results for all four individuals
3. Normalize marker sets to a shared panel
4. Calculate pairwise distances and TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) with confidence intervals

**Expected Outcome:** A dated estimate of lineage divergence with clear uncertainty bounds, cross-checked against YFull branch TMRCA (YTree branch age estimates) values.

---

### **H5.4: Extended Family Network via Autosomal DNA**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 35%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Autosomal DNA matches across platforms may reveal collateral relatives between the Radzimowski, Garboś, and Mazgaj lines.

**Evidence Required:**
- Autosomal DNA matches with Mazgaj and Garboś surnames
- Shared matches indicating common ancestors
- Triangulation of shared segments

**Verification Steps:**
1. Search MyHeritage for Mazgaj and Garboś matches
2. Analyze shared matches between all parties
3. Triangulate shared DNA segments
4. Build extended family network

**Expected Outcome:** Identifies collateral relatives and confirms connections.

---

### **H5.5: Marcin Radzimowski (Tarnobrzeg) Autosomal Link**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 75%  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Hypothesis:** Marcin Radzimowski (Tarnobrzeg, Podkarpackie) is a collateral relative (MyHeritage match: ~5th cousin, ~21 cM shared DNA) within the Podkarpackie cluster and may carry an I-Y45113 lineage.

**Evidence Required:**
- Marcin's Y-DNA test (Y37/Y67/Y111 or Big Y/YFull (comprehensive Y-DNA test; YFull analyzes BAM/VCF files))
- Confirmation of the autosomal match (segment data) and genealogical tree
- Location/time alignment with Tarnobrzeg/Jadachy/Sokołów Małopolski cluster

**Verification Steps:**
1. Contact Marcin Radzimowski via MyHeritage; request Y-DNA test (FTDNA/YSEQ) and share of segment data
2. Align his paternal line with Tarnobrzeg records; request family tree extracts
3. Compare Y-DNA (if tested) to I-Y224059/I-Y45233 carriers; compute STR/SNP distance

**Expected Outcome:** Validates/refutes Podkarpackie clustering and may add another modern comparator under I-Y45113.

---

### **H5.6: Ciepłe (Gniew) Early Medieval Elite Link**
**Status:** Speculative  
**Confidence:** 20%  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Hypothesis:** The northern Pomeranian Radzimowski cluster (H3.7) may share deep ancestry with early medieval elites associated with the Ciepłe cemetery (late 10th–early 11th century), but confirmation requires ancient DNA.

**Evidence Present (Verified Archaeology):**
- UW archaeology project describes the Ciepłe settlement complex (Tczew County) as late 10th/early 11th century and tied to early Piast expansion and Vistula trade routes.
- Antiquity reports richly furnished chamber graves at Ciepłe indicating elite status; strontium suggests both local and western Scandinavian origins.
- Gdańsk Archaeological Museum project notes elite burials and ongoing analyses, with cultural traits linked to Scandinavian, Rus’, and Slavic traditions.

**Evidence Required:**
- Published aDNA/Y‑DNA haplogroup data from Ciepłe (if available)
- Confirmed Y‑DNA from the northern Radzimowski cluster (H3.7)
- Comparative analysis between I‑Y45113 and any Ciepłe/Bodzia Y‑DNA profiles

**Verification Steps:**
1. Review publications from the Ciepłe project for aDNA results
2. Contact the Ciepłe research team about Y‑DNA availability/comparison
3. Test living male-line descendants from the northern cluster (H3.7)
4. Compare Y‑DNA with any published Ciepłe/Bodzia haplogroups

**Expected Outcome:** Confirms or refutes a deep-time link between the northern Radzimowski cluster and early medieval elites.

**Outreach Note (Draft, Ciepłe Project Team):**
Subject: Inquiry on Ciepłe aDNA/Y‑DNA results for comparative genealogy  
Hello Dr. Wadyl / Ciepłe Project Team,  
I’m conducting a genealogical study of a Radzimowski male line documented in the Gniew/Piaseczno area (17th–20th c.). We have Y‑DNA results (I‑Y45113) and are exploring whether any published or unpublished aDNA/Y‑DNA data from the Ciepłe cemetery might be suitable for comparison.  
Could you advise whether Y‑DNA haplogroups or BAM/VCF-level data (BAM: compressed binary alignment; VCF: variant call format) are available (or planned) for the Ciepłe burials, and if external comparison is possible?  
Thank you for your time, and I’m happy to share our summary and consented Y‑DNA details if helpful.  
Best regards,  
[Name / affiliation]  
[Contact]

**aDNA/Y‑DNA Comparison Checklist:**
1. Confirm Ciepłe sample list and accession IDs in publications  
2. Determine if Y‑DNA haplogroups are reported; request if not published  
3. Ensure modern Y‑DNA test type and coverage (Big Y/YFull (comprehensive Y-DNA test)) are documented  
4. Normalize terminology (Y‑SNP nomenclature and build version)  
5. Compare haplogroup placement on a common tree (YFull/FTDNA (YTree vs FTDNA's Y-DNA tree))  
6. Record uncertainty (coverage, contamination, sample quality)  
7. Document permissions and ethical constraints for any data use

## TIER 6: SPECIALIZED RESEARCH HYPOTHESES

### **H6.1: Ukrainian Radzymowski Connection**
**Status:** Evidence Present — **Testing Required**
**Confidence:** 45% (up from 30%; Wikipedia documents multiple notable Ukrainian Radzimovsky families)
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (upgraded from MEDIUM)

**Hypothesis:** Ukrainian Radzymowski families (Радзимовський spelling) may be patrilineal cousins of the Polish branch. Y-DNA testing would determine if they share the I-Y45113 lineage.

**Etymology Link:** See "SURNAME ETYMOLOGY & HISTORICAL CONTEXT" section above — Радзимовський is the Cyrillic orthographic form of Radzimowski, both deriving from the town of Radzymin (chartered 1475). This is a **script change**, not a separate surname.

**⚠️ January 2026 Update — Ukrainian Radzimovsky Evidence:**
Ukrainian Wikipedia (uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Радзимовський) documents multiple notable Radzimovsky individuals in Ukraine spanning 19th-21st centuries:

| Person | Dates | Role | Location |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| Віталій Іванович Радзимовський | 1905-1975 | Engineer, engineering mechanics specialist | Ukraine → USA |
| Ольга Іванівна Радзимовська | 1905-? | Doctor of medicine | Ukraine |
| Дмитро Олександрович Радзимовський | 1903-1985 | Hydrobiologist, NASU Institute | Kyiv |
| Радзимовський (first name unknown) | 1917-1918 | Court judge, Russian Orthodox Council member | Kyiv |
| Іоанн Радзимовський | 19th c. | Protopriest, built first stone church in Zvenyhorodka | Cherkasy region |
| Петро Едуардович Радзимовський | ~1906 | Teacher at Romny women's gymnasium | Poltava region |
| Броніслав Казимирович Радзимовський | Contemporary | Information security specialist | Odesa |

**Critical Observation:** These families **retained the Radzimowski surname** in Ukraine for multiple generations. This challenges the assumption that migrants necessarily changed surnames (see H3.3 revision).

**Geographic Distribution:** Ukrainian Radzimovskys documented in:
- Kyiv (scientists, judges)
- Cherkasy region (clergy)
- Poltava region (educators)
- Odesa (contemporary)

**Implications for H3.3:**
If Ukrainian Radzimovskys are tested and found to carry I-Y45113:
1. Confirms shared patrilineal ancestry with Polish Radzimowski
2. Suggests the lineage was present in both Poland and Ukraine historically
3. Complicates the "Berezhnoy = migrants who changed surname" narrative

**Evidence Required:**
- Y-DNA testing of Ukrainian Radzymowski male-line descendants
- Family trees showing Ukrainian branch origins
- Historical records linking Ukrainian Radzimovsky families to Polish origins (or indigenous Ukrainian development)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Identify living male-line Ukrainian Radzimovsky descendants (via Wikipedia references, Ukrainian genealogical societies)
2. Contact and request Y-DNA testing (FTDNA Y-37/Y-67/Y-111 or Big Y-700)
3. Compare Y-DNA with Polish Radzimowski (Andrzej's I-Y224059)
4. If match confirmed: Calculate TMRCA between Polish and Ukrainian branches
5. Document whether Ukrainian branch is under I-Y224059, I-Y45233, or a separate I-Y45113 sub-branch

**Expected Outcome:** Either confirms shared I-Y45113 lineage (supporting dual-region presence since medieval times) or reveals separate Y-DNA lineage (surname coincidence or heraldic adoption without genetic connection).

**🔬 Publication Potential:**
If Ukrainian Radzimovsky tests **positive for I-Y45113**, this would be publishable:

> **"Y-DNA Evidence of Polish-Ukrainian Patrilineal Continuity in the Radzimowski/Радзимовський Family, 1475-2026"**

Such a paper would demonstrate:
1. ✅ Ukrainian Радзимовськs and Polish Radzimowski share a common male-line ancestor
2. ✅ The surname (same family, different alphabets) preserved genetic identity across ~500 years
3. ✅ Migration/settlement occurred during Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth era (1569-1795)
4. ✅ Family persisted through Russian Empire, Soviet period, and into modern Ukraine

**Important Caveat:** A positive I-Y45113 result confirms **shared patrilineal ancestry** but does NOT definitively prove migration direction. The lineage could have:
- Originated in Poland and migrated to Ukraine (traditional narrative)
- Originated in Ukraine and migrated to Poland (reverse flow)
- Been present in both regions since medieval times (dual-origin)

Additional evidence (documentary records, autosomal DNA, TMRCA calculations) would be needed to distinguish between these scenarios.

### **H6.2: Linguistic Etymology Analysis**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** 30%  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Hypothesis:** Surname etymologies may reflect place-name or occupational origins, but this requires independent linguistic and historical evidence.

**Evidence Required:**
- Place name research
- Historical linguistic analysis
- Early surname usage patterns

**Verification Steps:**
1. Research place names matching surnames
2. Analyze linguistic roots
3. Check early surname variations
4. Compare with historical naming patterns

**Expected Outcome:** Clarifies surname origins.

---

## TIER 7: NEGATIVE CONTROL HYPOTHESES (To Rule Out)

### **H7.1: Two Unrelated Radzimowski Lineages**
**Status:** Pending Verification  
**Confidence:** Unknown (no data)  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Hypothesis:** Andrzej's Radzimowski lineage and the Podkarpackie Radzimowski families represent two separate lineages with different Y-DNA, connected only through heraldic clan membership.

**Evidence Required:**
- Different Y-DNA haplogroups
- No autosomal DNA matches
- Separate geographic origins

**Verification Steps:**
1. Compare Y-DNA haplogroups
2. Check autosomal DNA matches
3. Analyze geographic distribution

**Expected Outcome:** If confirmed, rules out patrilineal connection.

---

### **H7.2: Berezhnoy Not Connected**
**Status:** Disfavored (YFull (YTree database) confirms Aleksei I-Y45233 under I-Y45113)  
**Confidence:** 10%  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Hypothesis:** Aleksei Berezhnoy's Y-DNA lineage is not related to the Polish Radzimowski-Garboś-Mazgaj cluster.

**Evidence Required:**
- Different Y-DNA haplogroup
- No shared autosomal DNA
- Different migration patterns

**Verification Steps:**
1. Compare family histories
2. Analyze geographic origins
3. Check autosomal DNA matches

**Expected Outcome:** If confirmed, rules out connection.

## DECISION TREE (Y-DNA OUTCOMES)

- **Wladyslaw = I-Y224059** → H1.1 confidence ↑; four-way cluster confirmed under I-Y45113 with Andrzej/Artur. Proceed to STR/SNP TMRCA (H5.3).
- **Wladyslaw = I-Y45233** → Two-sister-branch model; integrate with Aleksei; revisit migration hypotheses (H3.3).
- **Wladyslaw ≠ I-Y45113** → Pivot to heraldic-only linkage; H7.1 risk increases; keep Artur/Aleksei/Andrzej cluster intact.
- **Doug Skory Big Y (if available)** → Place on I-Y45113 tree; if I-Y224059 or I-Y45233, add as fifth modern comparator for TMRCA; if different, treat as parallel branch for Ukraine/USA migration.

## KEY METRICS

- **Total Hypotheses:** 36 (added RA.6: VK157 Belt Fitting Tamga Evidence, RA.7: Rollo/Norman Dynasty Connection)
- **High Confidence (70%+):** 4 confirmed (H0.2, H1.1, H1.4, H5.5) + 2 conditional (H3.4, H3.5) + 5 ancient DNA (RA.1 95%, RA.2 80%, RA.3 85%, RA.4 70%, **RA.6 85%**)
- **Critical Priority (🔴 URGENT):** 13 (Doug confirmation, Wladyslaw YFull upload, Wladyslaw-Doug haplotype comparison, Casimir priest link, Casimir family link, Y-DNA connection, Wladyslaw placement, Skory migration branch, TMRCA, RA.1 Rurikid NPE analysis, RA.3 Emnilda verification, RA.4 Genealogia Welforum verification, **RA.5 Anglo-Norman matches verification**, **RA.6 tamga evidence verification**)
- **Upgraded Priority:** H6.1 (Ukrainian Radzymowski Connection) upgraded to HIGH due to Wikipedia evidence; **RA.5 upgraded to HIGH** (de Warenne/Hastings MTA Deep Dive matches to VK157)
- **Confidence Adjustments (January 2026):** H3.3 reduced to **25%** (Ukrainian Radzimovsky evidence + Aleksei's Polish fluency is self-taught, NOT family transmission); H6.1 increased to 45% (documentary evidence of Ukrainian families); **RA.5 increased to 60%** (MTA Deep Dive matches)
- **New Hypotheses (January 23, 2026):** **RA.6: VK157 Belt Fitting Tamga Evidence** — LKP expert analysis (50+ years tamga research) establishes VK157's bident tamga proves senior Rurikid line membership; Pskov burial parallel (2007) shows only other known bident tamga find; eliminates "mercenary" interpretation. **RA.7: Rollo/Norman Dynasty Connection** — MTA Deep Dive matches link VK157 to de Warenne (I1-S10360) and Hastings (I1-Y24790), both tracing to Rollo; suggests common Viking-era elite ancestor population.
- **New Data (January 23, 2026):** G25 coordinates added to `data/raw/g25_coordinates/` — andrzej_zak closest to VK159 (Kievan Rus') at 0.0326, confirming Eastern Slavic genetic pull
- **Estimated Research Time:** 3-6 months core; 4-8 months with Skory integration
- **Potential Outcome:** A validated patrilineal linkage with defensible dating; historical attribution only if independently supported; Rurikid genealogy revision based on Y-DNA evidence; VK157 = Svyatopolk identification strengthened by RA.3 and RA.4; Yaroslav's propaganda campaign documented; **I-Z63 elite network mapping across Anglo-Norman, Brandenburg, and Volga regions**

## NOTES

- Current SNP/STR evidence covers Andrzej (I-Y224059); Aleksei is placed at I-Y45233 via YFull matches, but no raw SNP/STR file is present here for him.
- YFull tree data provided by the user indicates: I-Y45113 formed ~3800 ybp (years before present, per YFull definition: years ago before current year, not 1950-based) (TMRCA ~1050 ybp), I-Y224059 formed ~1050 ybp (TMRCA ~700 ybp), I-Y45233 formed ~1050 ybp (TMRCA ~200 ybp).
- **January 2026 Update (Aleksei's email):** YFull age refinement to ~700 ybp confirmed; Aleksei notes surprise at this update. Wladyslaw Y-STR distances confirmed (4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei). Doug Skory Y-STR distances confirmed (2/25, 4/37, 6/67, 10/111 from Aleksei). Doug Skory Big Y-700 NOT completed despite 2022 funding commitment. Wladyslaw is NOT Aleksei's Family Finder cousin (no autosomal DNA sharing, consistent with deep-lineage patrilineal connection).
- `data/raw/y_dna_results/STR_statistic_for_YF079056.csv` flags private mutations (DYS608, DYS562, DYS389II, DYS471, DYS576) and branch-level STR stats for I-Y224059 and I-Y45113.
- `data/raw/y_dna_results/YFull _ STR matches3.pdf` is a longer distant-match list with diverse terminal haplogroups (Terminal Hg: youngest branch); it adds breadth but not direct lineage proof.
- Autosomal ancient DNA matching at low SNP counts should be treated as exploratory signals, not proof of direct descent.
- Confidence levels are provisional and should be updated only with verifiable genetic or archival evidence.
- Negative control hypotheses help rule out alternative explanations.
- Core Y-DNA comparator set: Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei, Wladyslaw; Doug becomes a fifth comparator if H0.1 is confirmed.
- Skory integration (contact strategy, Big Y status, migration branch) is documented in `docs/HYPOTHESIS_SKORY.md`; refer there for details and outreach steps.

## JANUARY 2026 REVISION NOTE: UKRAINIAN RADZIMOVSKY FAMILIES

**Source:** Ukrainian Wikipedia (uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Радзимовський)

**Discovery:** Multiple notable Ukrainian Radzimovsky (Радзимовський) families documented in Ukraine spanning 19th-21st centuries, who retained the Radzimowski surname rather than adopting Ukrainian alternatives.

**Impact on Research:**
1. **H3.3 (Berezhnoy Migration):** Confidence reduced from 45% to **25%**. The simple "Poland → Ukraine migration with surname change" narrative is now questioned. Two key factors:
   - Ukrainian Radzimovskys kept their surname — why would Aleksei's ancestors have adopted "Berezhnoy"?
   - **Aleksei's Polish fluency is self-taught** (his parents did NOT speak Polish) — this is NOT evidence of Polish family origins

2. **H6.1 (Ukrainian Radzymowski Connection):** Confidence increased from 30% to 45%, priority upgraded from MEDIUM to HIGH. Y-DNA testing of Ukrainian Radzimovsky male-line descendants is now a priority to determine if they share I-Y45113 lineage.

3. **Alternative Model:** The I-Y45113 lineage may have been present in both Poland and Ukraine since medieval times (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth era), rather than originating exclusively in Poland with later migration to Ukraine.

**Action Items:**
- Identify living male-line Ukrainian Radzimovsky descendants for Y-DNA testing
- Interview Aleksei about family oral history regarding Polish origins vs. continuous Ukrainian presence
- Search Ukrainian archives for earliest "Berezhnoy" records in Aleksei's family village
