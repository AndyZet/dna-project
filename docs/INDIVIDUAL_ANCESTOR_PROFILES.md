  - YFull STR distance: 7 differences over 462 STRs (distance 0.015)
  - Common ancestor: ~1325 CE (late medieval period)
- **Possibly close to Doug:** ~300 ybp TMRCA (if Big Y-700 confirms)
  - Estimated common ancestor: ~1725 CE
  - This would be within reach of parish records
- **Connection to Marcin:** Autosomal DNA match (5th cousin, 21.1 cM, 0.3%, 3 segments on chromosomes 2/11/17, 73 common matches)
  - Geographic proximity: Tarnobrzeg, Podkarpackie
  - Suggests collateral relationship

### Most Probable Ancestor
- **Medieval Polish noble**, member of **Grzymała heraldic clan**
- Common ancestor with Artur lived **~1325 CE** (late medieval period)
