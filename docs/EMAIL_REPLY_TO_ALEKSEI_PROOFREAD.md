Dear All,

Thank you very much for your detailed update and for sharing the Y-STR distance data for both Wladyslaw Mazgaj and Doug Skory. This information is extremely valuable for our investigation.

I was particularly interested to learn that both Wladyslaw and Doug share the same Y111 distance (10/111) from you, despite their different intermediate marker patterns. Your suggestion that they may be very close to each other if their mutations align is an excellent insight—this could indeed indicate a distinct sub-branch formation within I-Y45113, which would significantly refine our phylogenetic model.

Regarding Wladyslaw's background: you mentioned that his maternal ancestor Anastasia Sheszcuk has Ukrainian names, and you asked whether "Wladyslaw" is a Polish name. Yes, it is a Polish name, and the surname Mazgaj is very popular in Poland. This raises an important question: **Is Wladyslaw himself of Ukrainian origin, or does he represent a Polish family with Ukrainian maternal ancestry?** Understanding his geographic and cultural background would help us better contextualize the migration patterns we're investigating.

I also noted your surprise about YFull's age refinement to 700 years for the I-Y224059 branch. This update is indeed significant, and it aligns with the TMRCA estimates we've been working with.

**Regarding Doug Skory:** I will contact him and his family (Judith Skory, primary contact) this week to follow up on the Big Y-700 test. As you mentioned, despite the funding commitment from February 2022, the test has not yet been ordered.

I also plan to contact Wladyslaw directly, as you suggested, to request his YFull upload.

The fact that Wladyslaw is not your Family Finder cousin, despite the Y111 distance of 10/111, is also informative—it confirms that the patrilineal connection is deep-lineage (consistent with the I-Y45113 TMRCA of ~1050 ybp).

Thank you again for your continued collaboration and for keeping us updated on these important developments. Your insights and the genetic data you're providing are fundamental to advancing this investigation.

I'll keep you posted on my progress with contacting Doug and Wladyslaw.

All the best,
Andrzej
