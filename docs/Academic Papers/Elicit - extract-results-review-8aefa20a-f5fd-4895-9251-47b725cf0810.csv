The People Rus' in the Ninth – Middle Eleventh Centuries: New Approaches to the Study of Ethnogenesis and Politogenesis,A. Shchavelev,10.30884/seh/2025.01.02,https://doi.org/10.30884/seh/2025.01.02,Social Evolution &amp; History,0,2025,"The formation of the Rurikid polity and the people called Rus' was influenced by trade routes and urbanization. Historical evidence from documents like treaties and statutes is used to support this interpretation. The early state in Rus' was established by the mid-eleventh century, with the Rurikids adopting writing technology after joining the Byzantine Christian Church. The source does not provide genetic or archaeological evidence, focusing on historical narratives and documents.","  - ""The main aim of this article is to try to give an outline of modern understanding of processes and mechanisms of formation of the people called Rus' and the polity of the Rurikid lineage.""
  - ""New interpretations of written sources are placed in the basis of the proposed approach.""
  - ""The later Old Russian narratives, first of all, the ‘Primary Chronicle’, are recognized as unreliable and secondary sources, and the basic factual basis is formed on the basis of documents (treaties, statutes and legal codes, etc.) and synchronous for the tenth century narrative texts,""
  - ""Following these guidelines, the article substantiates the following provisions. First, the autocatalytic process of development of a network of long-distance trade routes and the emergence of urban centres in their hubs became the basic factor for the formation of medium-scale polities on the East European Plain.""
  - ""Second, in the new settlements of the Upper and Middle Dnieper area in the tenth century, new mixed urban communities were formed, including groups of people who called themselves Rus'.""
  - ""Third, no medium-size polity of the ninth and tenth centuries had the characteristics of an early state, because it was an ecumene without developed writing abilities.""
  - ""Only the complex chiefdom under the leadership of the Rurikids, after joining the Byzantine Christian Church, gained access to the technology of writing.""
  - ""By the mid-eleventh century, the early state in Rus' was established.""
  - ""In the same period, the elite and the population of the ‘Rurikid empire’ finally adopted the ethno-political label Rus', as a result of which a new Christian people with such a name appeared on the map of the Western Eurasia.""",,"- The abstract discusses the formation of the people called Rus' and the polity of the Rurikid lineage, which aligns with the research question on the origins and early expansion of the Rurik Dynasty.
- The source uses new interpretations of written sources and documents like treaties and statutes, which are historical evidence.
- The abstract mentions the development of trade routes and urban centers as factors in the formation of polities, which relates to historical evidence.
- The mention of mixed urban communities and the adoption of the ethno-political label ""Rus'"" suggests integration processes, although it does not explicitly mention Scandinavian-Slavic integration.
- The abstract does not mention genetic or archaeological evidence, focusing instead on historical documents and narratives.
- The methodology involves reinterpreting written sources and using documents from the tenth century, which is a historical approach."
The Rurikids: The First Experience of Reconstructing the Genetic Portrait of the Ruling Family of Medieval Rus’ Based on Paleogenomic Data,"K. Zhur, F. S. Sharko, Vkadimir V. Sedov, M.

  - ""The reconstruction of the genome of Prince Dmitry Alexandrovich indicates the contribution of three ancestral components to his origin: (1) the early medieval population of the east of Scandinavia from the island of Oland, (2) representatives of the steppe nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes of the Iron Age or the early medieval population of central Europe (steppe nomads from the territory of Hungary), and (3) the ancient East-Eurasian component.""",,"- The main finding is the genetic analysis of a Rurikid member, Prince Dmitry Alexandrovich, which reveals his Y chromosome belongs to the N1a haplogroup, indicating a genetic lineage that can be traced back to at least the XI century.
- The strength of the evidence is based on genome-wide paleogenetic analysis, which provides a direct genetic link to the Rurikid dynasty.
- The methodology involves genome-wide paleogenetic analysis of bone remains, which is a robust method for determining genetic ancestry."
