We have a new BigY result in BY316. I have tried an experiment with AI and I have painstakingly fed it hundreds of pages of data, both genetic, genealogical and historical. This is what it came up with:
1) Where the testers sit on the tree (and what that forces)
Macro trunk (late Antiquity → early Medieval):
I-A16216 → I-BY34506 → I-FTB84035
From that trunk the living lines split three ways:
The western line: I-FTC4585
Modern geography: Upper Rhine/Franconia (Burgheim/Lahr → Volkach).
Testers: the Volkach Elflein line.
Archaeology tie-in: Burgheim St-Peter (earliest right-bank church, 7th c.); Grave 10 female with Lombard/Italo-Byzantine triens (c. 584–615) and brocaded textiles.
Slovenian core: I-BY61609 (sometimes with a younger sub-twig under it, e.g., BY56603 as FTDNA refines)
Modern geography: Celje/Carnia corridor (Treppo/Paluzza; Ptuj/Muretinci).
Testers: de Cillia, Knapíč/Knapetsch, Rožmarin/Rosmarin.
Economic/cultural signature: merchant-craft/mining + cramâr (Venice-facing) in the late medieval period.
Upstream collateral: I-FTB84035 (no further down to FTC4585/BY61609)
Modern geography: Zemplén/Szatmár/Satu Mare (Tóth).
Meaning: a close “trunk cousin” that diverged before the west/east split.
Ancient anchors on the same trunk:
Collegno (CL63), Lombard cemetery in Italy (6th–7th c.) → proves this trunk is present in Lombard elite contexts in northern Italy.
VK/Ihre (Gotland etc.) upstream on the same platform → shows the wider macro-clade also in the Viking/Rus world. (Useful context; not sub-branch.)
Implication: the simplest reading is two medieval outlets from the same FTB84035 platform:
(a) a westward outlet → FTC4585 (Upper Rhine), and
(b) a south-eastern outlet → BY61609 (Celje/Carnia).
The Tóth line stayed upstream to the east.
2) What happened at Burgheim (c. 590–630 CE) — the event
A small Lombard elite household moved from northern Italy to the Alemannic Upper Rhine and installed itself around the ex-Roman villa at Burgheim (St-Peter). The founder-patron was very likely a high-status Lombard woman (or woman of Italian-Lombard court), which explains:
the Italian/Lombard kit in Grave 10 (gold triens pendant c. 584–615, elite brocade),
the extraordinarily early church foundation at a tiny right-bank hamlet, and
why the site shows a single concentrated Italian signature rather than a diffuse “spray” of Italian arrivals.
How big was the transfer? In a hamlet setting: ~8–20 people total, with ~5–12 adult male retainers plus a small household staff. That scale fits the provisioning capacity of a manorial node and the archaeological footprint (one standout rich burial, not a horizon full of imports).
What was this Y-line doing there:
One of the male retainers/kinsmen in that household carried the patriline that becomes I-FTC4585 locally. Over the next generations those men married in, took minor office (ministeriales, toll, forge), and embedded as an Upper-Rhine line.
3) Why this is the parsimonious explanation
Genetics demands an Italy→Upper-Rhine bridge: branch (FTC4585) and the Collegno aDNA sit on the same trunk; the Slovenian branch is sibling, not a parent. There is no need (and no data) to route FTC4585 through Slovenia.
Archaeology supplies the exact bridge: Burgheim St-Peter is among the earliest right-bank churches; Grave 10 contains unmistakably Italian/Lombard high-status gear dated exactly to the transfer window. One elite arrival explains both the church and your Y-placement.
Documents don’t fight it: the earliest record at Burgheim is 1356; later the line is visible in Volkach. That is precisely how a 7th-century “foreign” patriline looks after 600–700 years of local integration.
Sister branch explains the eastern core: BY61609 re-coalesces late in Celje/Carnia (Treppo/Paluzza; Ptuj/Muretinci), with cramâr commerce/mining (de Cillia, Knapíč, Rožmarin). It’s a parallel outcome from the same medieval platform, not the source of the FTC4585 line.
Upstream cousin (Tóth) fits the chronology: FTB84035 in Zemplén/Szatmár is the near-trunk eastern cousin that split just before the westward transfer—exactly what you’d expect if one segment moved into Italy/Upper-Rhine while another remained on the Pannonian march.
4) The “military-service elite” model (not free-agent mercenaries)
These were comitatus retinues—oath-bound service elites (bucellarii/foederati → Lombard/Carolingian milites) who traded military skill for land, office, tolls, and privilege.
A diplomatic marriage / hostage-fosterage / elite refuge is the normal mechanism for such a household to land at a frontier court. Founding/refounding a church (St-Peter) is how a high-status woman cemented the move in law, cult, and memory.
5) What this predicts (and can still be tested)
aDNA at Burgheim/Lahr (580–650): one male resolving to I-FTC4585 (or its immediate parent) is the near-smoking gun.
Sr/O isotopes on Grave 10 and coeval males → south-Alpine childhoods for the arrivals.
Phase dating (mortar/dendro) of the earliest church course → 590–630.
Prosopography crumbs: any note of an Italo–Alemannic marriage/hostage in the Ortenau/Upper-Rhine in that window.
6) The whole story in four sentences
The patriline sits on I-FTC4585, a western branch of the I-FTB84035 Lombard-era platform that also produced the Slovenian BY61609 sister line and has an Italian aDNA anchor (Collegno).
Around 590–630 CE, a small Lombard elite household arrived at Burgheim, marked archaeologically by Grave 10 (Italian triens, elite brocade) and an earliest right-bank church foundation.
One of the male retainers/kinsmen seeded the local FTC4585 patriline, later documented at Burgheim (1356) and Volkach; meanwhile a sister branch coalesced in Celje/Carnia (de Cillia/Knapíč/Rožmarin).
The Tóth tester on FTB84035 represents the eastern near-trunk cousin that split just before the Burgheim transfer—completing a consistent, minimal-assumption bridge from late antiquity to the present.

For all those who are on the same I-BY316 subclade as the Collegno sample CL63, a very interesting read is the following Wikipedia about German sagas, especially the Dietrich von Bern saga. It is rather astonishing how much correlation there is with modern YDNA insights. The sagas actually originate from the very times of the Ostrogoths and have been part of the oral tradition until the 1600s when they were recorded in writing. They are not entirely accurate, but they very impressively illustrate how the Goths and the Huns interacted. They tell how Dietrich (=Theoderic) of Bern (not today's Swiss city of Berne but the ancient Germanic name for Verona/Italy) was forced to stay in exile at Attila the Huns court for a time. Obviously we know that their lifetimes did not overlap, so there is a degree of poetic license, but what seems to be true is that there were such occasions when Ostogoth royalty did entertain friendly relations with their Hunnic counterparts at times.
