Dear Wladyslaw Mazgaj,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you regarding a genealogical research project involving several families with shared Y-DNA ancestry.

Through Y-DNA testing at FTDNA, we have discovered that you share a close genetic connection with other individuals in our study group, including Aleksei Berezhnoy. This indicates that our families share a common ancestor approximately 1,000 years ago—around the time of the early medieval period in Central and Eastern Europe.

**What makes this particularly fascinating:** Our shared lineage (I-Y45113) appears to have connections to medieval elite networks in the region. We are investigating potential links to archaeological sites like the Bodzia cemetery (10th-11th century, central Poland), which contains burials of Scandinavian-Rus' warriors and elites from the early Piast period. Some of our related families trace their documented origins to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth borderlands, suggesting our common ancestor may have been part of the medieval elite networks that shaped the history of this region. Your participation could help us better understand these historical connections.

**I would like to request:**

If you have completed a Big Y test at FTDNA, would you be willing to upload your results to YFull? This would help us better understand the genetic relationships within our shared lineage. YFull is a free service that provides additional analysis of Y-DNA test results.

**I am happy to help:** If you are not familiar with YFull or need assistance with the upload process, I would be glad to guide you through it step-by-step. It is a straightforward process that takes only a few minutes, and I can provide detailed instructions or answer any questions you might have.

I would also be grateful for any information you feel comfortable sharing about your family's geographic origins and history, as we are investigating migration patterns across several related families.

If you have any questions or would like more information, please feel free to ask. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Andrzej Zak
