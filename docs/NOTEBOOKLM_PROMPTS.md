# NotebookLM Prompts for Ancestors Presentation

**Purpose:** Ready-to-use prompts for NotebookLM to generate the presentation, visualizations, and supporting materials

**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Prompt 1: Create the Main Presentation

**Copy and paste this prompt into NotebookLM:**

```
Create a 19-slide presentation titled "The Seven Cousins: Tracing Our Most Probable Ancestors" that:

1. Shows genetic connections between Andrzej, Artur, Aleksei Berezhnoy, Doug Skory, Marcin Radzimowski, Anatoly Berezhnoy, and Władysław Mazgaj

2. Identifies most probable ancestors with specific timeframes based on TMRCA (Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor) and genealogical evidence:
   - ~975 CE: Common ancestor at I-Y45113 level (all 7 cousins)
   - ~1325 CE: I-Y224059 split (Andrzej, Artur, possibly Marcin)
   - 1700s-1800s: Podkarpackie cluster (Józef Garboś 1710, Franciszek Mazgaj 1779)
   - ~1825 CE: Aleksei-Anatoly split (most recent, 200 ybp TMRCA)

3. Presents Bodzia connection as a TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS (not a proven claim):
   - VK157 (Bodzia) has Y-DNA I1-S2077
   - Phylogenetic path: I-S2077 → I-Y49957 → I-Y45113 (our branch)
   - Timeframe match: I-Y45113 formation (~975 CE) = Bodzia active period (950-1020 CE)
   - Requires published Bodzia aDNA data to test

4. Includes individual profiles for each of the 7 people:
   - Andrzej (I-Y224059, Mazowieckie, Poland)
   - Artur (I-Y224059, Jadachy, Podkarpackie, earliest known: Józef Garboś b. 1710)
   - Aleksei Berezhnoy (I-Y45233, Ukraine, same village since 1730)
   - Anatoly Berezhnoy (I-Y45233, Ukraine, same village as Aleksei)
   - Doug Skory (Y111 tested, Big Y-700 pending, USA, migration: Poland → Ukraine → USA)
   - Władysław Mazgaj (I-Y45113, terminal SNP pending, Sokołów Małopolski, earliest known: Franciszek Mazgaj b. 1779)
   - Marcin Radzimowski (Autosomal match, Y-DNA test needed, Tarnobrzeg, Podkarpackie)

5. Uses clear visualizations:
   - Family tree showing all 7 individuals with TMRCA labels
   - Timeline from 975 CE to present with key ancestors
   - Migration map (Poland → Ukraine → USA)
   - Haplogroup tree (I-Y45113 structure with sub-branches)
   - Geographic cluster map (Podkarpackie region, all within 45 km)

6. Maintains scientific accuracy while being engaging:
   - Distinguish between "known" (high confidence) and "testable hypothesis" (needs verification)
   - Use accurate TMRCA estimates from YFull (YTree database)
   - Cite genetic evidence (Y-DNA, Y-STR distances, autosomal matches)
   - Present Bodzia as hypothesis, not claim

7. Includes speaker notes (30-60 seconds per slide) that:
   - Explain genetic concepts in accessible language
   - Connect personal stories to historical context
   - Emphasize testable nature of hypotheses
   - Provide clear calls to action

8. Structure:
   - Part 1: The Genetic Family Tree (Hook) - 2 slides
   - Part 2: Most Probable Ancestors (Core Content) - 4 slides
   - Part 3: The Bodzia Hypothesis (Attention-Grabbing) - 2 slides
   - Part 4: Individual Profiles (Personal Connection) - 6 slides
   - Part 5: The Big Picture (Synthesis) - 3 slides
   - Part 6: Call to Action (Persuasive) - 2 slides

Make it attention-grabbing, understandable to non-geneticists, and scientifically rigorous.

## Prompt 4: Create Bodzia Hypothesis Section

**Copy and paste this prompt into NotebookLM:**

```
Write a detailed 3-slide section explaining the Bodzia connection as a TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS. Include:

SLIDE 1: "The Bodzia Connection - A Testable Hypothesis"
- What is Bodzia: Elite cemetery in central Poland, 950-1020 CE, excavated 2007-2009
- The genetic clue: VK157 (possible Sviatopolk I) has Y-DNA I1-S2077
- Phylogenetic path: I-S2077 → I-Y49957 → I-Y45113 (our branch)
- The hypothesis: Our common ancestor (~975 CE) may have been part of the same elite network as Bodzia
- Important: This is a TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS, not a proven claim
- How to test: Compare our Y-DNA with published Bodzia aDNA data when available

SLIDE 2: "Why Bodzia Matters"
- Historical context: Viking Age, early Piast Poland, Kievan Rus' connections
- Elite networks: Cross-cultural interactions, dynastic marriages, trade routes
- Our timeframe matches: I-Y45113 formation (~975 CE) = Bodzia active period (950-1020 CE)
- Migration pattern: Possible Rus' → Poland migration (I-FTC2520 → I-Y49957 → I-Y45113)
- What this means: If confirmed, our lineage was part of medieval elite networks

SLIDE 3: "Testing the Hypothesis"
- Required data: Published Bodzia aDNA data with Y-DNA haplogroups and SNP-level data
- Comparison method: Compare our Y-DNA SNPs with Bodzia Y-DNA SNPs
- What to look for: Shared mutations downstream of I-Y45113
- Falsification criteria: Hypothesis refuted if no phylogenetic connection or timeframe mismatch
- Current status: Pending published Bodzia aDNA data

Emphasize:
- "Testable hypothesis" language throughout
- Phylogenetic connection (tree structure), not direct match
- Timeframe match is intriguing but not proof
- Requires published aDNA data to test
- Historical context supports but doesn't prove hypothesis

Use clear, accessible language while maintaining scientific accuracy.

## Prompt 5: Create Migration Story Visualization

**Copy and paste this prompt into NotebookLM:**

```
Create a detailed description for an animated timeline and migration map showing:

TIMELINE (975 CE to 2026):
1. ~975 CE: Common ancestor (medieval Poland, possibly Rus' connection)
   - I-Y45113 formation
   - Possibly part of elite networks (Bodzia hypothesis)
   
2. ~1325 CE: I-Y224059 split (regional migration within Poland)
   - Płock region → Podkarpackie migration
   - Formation of Radzimowski and Garboś lines
   
3. 1700s-1800s: Podkarpackie cluster formation
   - Geographic clustering within 45 km
   - Families documented: Garboś (1710), Mazgaj (1779)

4. 1800s-1900s: Ukraine migration branches
   - Berezhnoy: Poland → Ukraine (Belgorod region)
   - Skory: Poland → Ukraine (Eastern Ukraine) → USA
   - Parallel migration patterns
   
5. 1900s: USA migration
   - Skory: Ukraine → USA (Ellis Island, ~1900-1920)
   - Grand Rapids, Michigan → Traverse City, Michigan

MIGRATION MAP:
- Origin points: Poland (Mazowieckie, Podkarpackie, Trzemeszno)
- Migration destinations: Ukraine (Belgorod, Eastern Ukraine)
- Final destinations: USA (Michigan)
- Arrows showing migration paths with dates
- Color code by family branch (I-Y224059 vs I-Y45233)
- Include key locations with labels

Provide specific coordinates, dates, and visual design recommendations.
```

## Prompt 6: Create Call to Action Section

**Copy and paste this prompt into NotebookLM:**

```
Create a compelling 2-slide call to action section:

SLIDE 1: "The Missing Pieces"
- List the 3 critical missing data points:
  1. Doug Skory: Big Y-700 needed (funding available, test pending)
  2. Władysław Mazgaj: YFull upload needed (terminal SNP pending)
  3. Marcin Radzimowski: Y-DNA test needed (autosomal match confirmed)
- Explain why each matters: More comparators = more accurate TMRCA calculations
- Show what we get from each test: Exact branch placement, TMRCA refinement, network strengthening
- Timeline: Immediate (Week 1), Short-term (Weeks 2-4), Medium-term (Weeks 4-8)

SLIDE 2: "Next Steps"
- Immediate actions (This Week):
  * Contact Doug Skory (re Big Y-700)
  * Contact Władysław Mazgaj (re YFull upload)
  * Contact Marcin Radzimowski (re Y-DNA test)
- Short-term goals (Weeks 2-4): Obtain results, upload to YFull, compare haplotypes
- Medium-term goals (Weeks 4-8): Calculate multi-way TMRCA, refine migration hypotheses
- Long-term goals (Months 2-3): Test Bodzia hypothesis, complete research report
- How audience can help: Share presentation, encourage testing, contribute records, support research

Make it action-oriented, specific, and motivating without being pushy.
```
