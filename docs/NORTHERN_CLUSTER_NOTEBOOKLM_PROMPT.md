```
You are preparing a short, focused presentation titled:

"The Northern Hypothesis: A Third Cluster?"

Use ONLY the information in the uploaded document(s) about:
- The northern Radzimowski cluster in Tczew County (Pomeranian Voivodeship)
- Ciepłe Cemetery as an elite Danish-connected site (980-1020 CE)
- The "Dual-Wing" theory (Bodzia = Rus' wing, Ciepłe = Danish wing)
Do NOT re-tell the full seven-cousins story; keep the focus on the northern hypothesis.

Your goals:
1. Create a clear, engaging 8-10 slide presentation (10-15 minutes) that:
   - Explains where Tczew County is and summarizes Radzimowski records there (1653-1934)
   - Introduces Ciepłe Cemetery and its elite Danish connection
   - Explains the Dual-Wing idea: Bodzia as a Rus'-aligned elite hub, Ciepłe as a Danish-aligned elite hub
   - Shows how the northern Radzimowski cluster might connect to this system
   - Clearly separates what we KNOW (records, geography, archaeology) from what is HYPOTHESIS (deep genetic links)
   - Ends with a realistic, concrete call to action (what data and tests we need next)

2. Match the visual and narrative tone of the attached slide:
   - Use map-based visuals (northern Poland, Tczew County, Ciepłe vs. Bodzia)
   - Use short, punchy slide titles (e.g., "Same County, Different Centuries", "If Confirmed… If Refuted")
   - Keep slide text concise and readable; put detail into speaker notes instead.

3. For EACH slide:
   - Provide:
     - Slide title
     - 1-2 sentence visual description (what the audience sees)
     - 3-6 short bullet points of on-slide text
     - 30-60 seconds of speaker notes, in plain, accessible language for non-specialists

4. Emphasize throughout:
   - This is a **testable hypothesis**, NOT a proven claim.
   - The key missing data:
     - Y-DNA test from a male-line Radzimowski descendant in the northern cluster
     - Published ancient DNA data from Ciepłe (Y-DNA haplogroups and SNP-level data)
   - Both positive and negative outcomes are scientifically useful.

5. Avoid:
   - Overstating the evidence or implying direct descent from named Ciepłe individuals
   - Going deep into the southern Podkarpackie cluster or the full seven-cousins tree (only brief context if absolutely necessary)

Output format:
- Number and title each slide (e.g., "Slide 1 – Title")
- Under each slide, clearly separate:
  - "Visual:"
  - "On-slide text:"
  - "Speaker notes:"
```

## Alternative Shorter Prompt (4-5 slides)

If you want a more condensed version, use this instead:

```
Create a 4-5 slide presentation on "The Northern Hypothesis: A Third Cluster?" focusing on:

1. Tczew County Radzimowski cluster (1653-1934) - what we know from records
2. Ciepłe Cemetery (980-1020 CE) - elite Danish connection
3. The hypothesis: Could northern Radzimowski families connect to Ciepłe elites?
4. What we need to test: Y-DNA from northern cluster + Ciepłe aDNA data

Keep it concise, visual (maps), and emphasize this is a TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS, not proven.
Each slide: title, 3-4 bullet points, 30-45 second speaker notes.
```
