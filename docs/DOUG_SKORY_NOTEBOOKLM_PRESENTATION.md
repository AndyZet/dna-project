# NotebookLM Presentation Kit: “Unlocking the Skory Roots with Big Y‑700”

Goal: help Douglas Skory (and/or Judith/Libby/other relatives) feel excited and confident enough to fund Doug’s FTDNA **Big Y‑700** upgrade, by showing (1) what we already know, (2) what Big Y uniquely answers, and (3) how it connects to a bigger, fun historical narrative **without overclaiming** (Vikings / Bodzia / Kievan Rus / Piast = “context + hypotheses”, not “proven descent”).

This file is designed to work in **NotebookLM** as a self-contained “one-file kit” (facts + timeline + deck outline + prompts + scripts).

## 1) “Source Notes” for NotebookLM (copy/paste friendly)

If you want cleaner results in NotebookLM, copy each sub-section below into separate NotebookLM notes (each becomes its own “source”).

### Source Note 1 — Who Doug is (profile)
Use placeholders if you prefer not to store personal info in the repo.

- Person: Douglas G. Skory (“Doug”)
- Current location: Traverse City, Michigan, USA
- Current test level: Y111 (FTDNA)
- Big Y-700 status: not ordered/completed as of January 2026
- Family contacts (optional):
  - Judith Skory (sister; primary contact)
  - Libby Tomlinson (niece; helped coordinate in 2021–2022)
  - Doug email (optional): `<DOUG_EMAIL>` (example seen in project notes: `dskory1820@aol.com`)
- Reported paternal-line origin for Doug’s line (needs parish confirmation):
  - Trzemeszno, Poland (spelling standardized as Trzemeszno)
- Doug line anchors mentioned in the project:
  - Great-grandfather: Anthony Skory, b. 1852-02-21, Trzemeszno, Poland
  - Earliest-known ancestor label in notes: Casimer Skory (details unknown)

### Source Note 2 — The key genetic facts (what we already know)
Hard evidence that motivates Big Y‑700:

- Reported Y‑STR distances (from Aleksei’s January 2026 update):
  - Aleksei ↔ Doug: 2/25, 4/37, 6/67, 10/111
  - Aleksei ↔ Wladyslaw: 4/37, 6/67, 10/111
- Interpretation in plain language:
  - This strongly suggests a shared paternal-line ancestor, but deep enough that autosomal sharing may be absent.

Key “status quote” (verbatim, for credibility):
- Aleksei (Jan 2026): “Unfortunately, Skory did not order the BigY test yet. We need to contact him and his relatives again about it.”

Current haplogroup framing in the project (SNP-level where known):
- Andrzej: I‑Y224059 (under I‑Y45113)
- Aleksei: I‑Y45233 (sister branch under I‑Y45113, per YFull)
- Doug: unknown at SNP level until Big Y‑700 (or equivalent SNP testing)

What Big Y‑700 can answer (unique value):
- Doug’s terminal SNP (exact branch)
- Whether Doug is closer to I‑Y224059, I‑Y45233, or forms a new nearby sub-branch under I‑Y45113
- Better TMRCA estimates and match ranking at SNP level

### Source Note 3 — What Bodzia / “Vikings / Rus / Piast” means here (no overclaiming)
We use early medieval history as context for curiosity and testable hypotheses, not as proof of descent.

Bodzia facts used in this project:
- Bodzia: elite cemetery in central Poland, ~950–1020 CE
- Two male Bodzia Y‑DNA calls cited in the project’s Bodzia report:
  - VK157: I1‑S2077
  - VK156: R1a‑SUR51 (reported as R1a-derived)

Important honesty:
- Our modern cluster of interest is I‑Y45113 (a different I subclade than VK157’s I1; and different from VK156’s R1a).
- So Bodzia is not presented as a “direct match”, but as a historically meaningful setting for asking better questions once we have Big Y placement.

How to phrase it:
- “Bodzia is the kind of place/time where lineages moved and mixed. Big Y tells us where our paternal line sits on the tree, and whether any published ancient datasets are even plausibly relevant.”

### Source Note 4 — The 2021–2022 funding story (what happened and why we’re restarting)
This is a summary of the email chain (focus: Big Y‑700 funding commitment).

- Proposal: Aleksei Berezhnoy + Artur Kupis + Andrzej Zak offered to cover the cost of upgrading Doug from Y111 to Big Y‑700.
- Stated cost at the time: $239 USD (note: current pricing may differ; check FTDNA at order time).
- Doug accepted the offer and agreed to move forward with the test upgrade.
- Payment plan: Andrzej would send $239 to Libby Tomlinson (Doug’s niece) to process the order (PayPal/Venmo suggested).
- The commitment stalled because payment details were not fully exchanged before the conversation shifted (March 2022) to Aleksei’s safety concerns due to regional political turmoil.
- By November 2022, the thread revived briefly, but the upgrade still was not ordered.
- January 2026 status update (per Aleksei): Big Y‑700 still not ordered; we should re-contact Doug/family and restart the process.

### Source Note 4b — What we need from Doug (to make this easy)
Minimal “next step” data to request from Doug/family:
- Confirmation: “Are you still open to upgrading to Big Y‑700?”
- FTDNA kit number (or screenshot of upgrade page)
- If available: export/screenshot of Doug’s Y111 marker values
- Permission preference:
  - Share results only privately with Andrzej/Aleksei/Artur
  - Or also upload to YFull (optional; increases research value)

### Source Note 5 — What we promise to deliver (to make funding feel safe)
If Doug/family funds Big Y‑700, we will provide:
- A “family-friendly” 1–2 page summary:
  - Doug’s terminal SNP and placement
  - Closest SNP matches and what they imply
  - A timeline (with uncertainty) for where the shared paternal ancestor likely sits
  - A short “what to do next” list for genealogy records
- Optional deep dive appendix:
  - A marker/variant summary
  - Proposed follow-up tests (YFull upload, targeted SNPs for relatives, etc.)

---

Keep personal info minimal (e.g., avoid full street addresses). Email addresses are okay if you need them for coordination.

---

## 2) Ground Rules (to keep it persuasive + accurate)

Use this language framing throughout the deck:
- “**We can test this**” / “**This would help confirm**” / “**This is consistent with**”
- Avoid “We are descended from Sviatopolk / Piasts / Vikings” unless explicitly labeled **speculative**.

Key factual guardrails (from the docs):
- Doug’s **Big Y‑700 was not ordered** as of January 2026 (Aleksei confirmation).
- Bodzia’s two reported male haplogroups in the Bodzia report are **VK157: I1‑S2077** and **VK156: R1a‑SUR51** (not I‑Y45113). So Bodzia is “historical/aDNA context”, not “direct match evidence”.

Also keep these persuasion guardrails:
- Emphasize “legacy” and “closure” rather than pressure.
- If they say no, offer an alternate: “please at least share screenshots of Y111 results so we can compare.”

---

## 3) The Story Arc (high-level)

**Hook → Proof → The Missing Key → Big History (as context) → Legacy → Simple Next Step**

1) Hook: “One test can place the Skory paternal line on the human family tree with high precision.”
2) Proof: We already have a strong Y‑DNA cousin signal between Doug and Aleksei / Wladyslaw at Y‑STR level.
3) Missing key: Only Big Y (SNP-level) tells us the exact branch and how the lines split.
4) Big history: Vikings / Rus / Piast / Bodzia are the “stage” where these lineages lived and moved—Big Y lets us test whether our line sits near any of those historical currents (not claiming direct descent).
5) Legacy: “This is a one-time gift to future generations.”
6) CTA: “Upgrade to Big Y‑700; we do the analysis and share a family-friendly report.”

---

## 4) Slide-by-Slide Deck (12 slides)

Use these as slide titles + bullet points.

### Slide 1 — Title
**Unlocking the Skory Paternal Line**  
“From Trzemeszno → Ukraine → Michigan (and deeper history we can test)”

### Slide 2 — The One Question
**What is the exact Skory Y‑DNA branch—and who is our most recent shared ancestor?**  
Big Y‑700 turns “we might be related” into “here is the branch + estimated timeline”.

### Slide 3 — What We Already Have (Doug’s current test)
**Doug already has Y‑111** (great start).  
But Y‑STR is like a “fingerprint approximation”; SNP testing is the “exact map location”.

### Slide 4 — The Hard Evidence: Close Y‑STR signal
From Aleksei’s January 2026 update (reported distances):
- Aleksei ↔ Doug: **2/25, 4/37, 6/67, 10/111**
- Aleksei ↔ Wladyslaw: **4/37, 6/67, 10/111**
Interpretation (plain language): strong evidence of a shared paternal-line ancestor (deep enough that autosomal may not show).

### Slide 5 — The Known Tree (what we can say today)
Current evidence in the project:
- Andrzej: **I‑Y224059** (under **I‑Y45113**)
- Aleksei: **I‑Y45233** (sister branch under **I‑Y45113**, per YFull)
Doug: unknown at SNP level until Big Y‑700.

### Slide 6 — What Big Y‑700 Uniquely Answers
Big Y‑700 can tell us:
- Doug’s **terminal SNP** (his exact branch)
- Whether Doug sits with **I‑Y224059**, **I‑Y45233**, or a new nearby branch
- Better **TMRCA estimates** (time to shared ancestor), vs STR-only guessing
- Which other kits/samples are closest matches at SNP level

### Slide 7 — Why It Matters to the Family (practical)
Big Y‑700 helps:
- Confirm/refute specific family-line hypotheses
- Focus genealogy research (which region/time-window matters most)
- Leave a clean, durable result for children/nieces/nephews

### Slide 8 — The “Big History” Context (Vikings / Rus / Piasts)
This is the fun part, framed correctly:
- Big Y doesn’t prove a king/warrior ancestor by itself
- But it can show whether our lineage sits in a region/time pattern consistent with medieval migrations and contact zones
- It turns legends into **testable questions**

### Slide 9 — Bodzia (how to talk about it without overclaiming)
Bodzia is a famous elite cemetery (~950–1020 CE) used in this project as context.
Important honesty:
- Bodzia male Y‑DNA in the report: **VK157 I1‑S2077**, **VK156 R1a‑SUR51**
- Our modern cluster is **I‑Y45113** (a different I subclade than VK157’s I1)
So: Bodzia is “historical/aDNA context”, not “direct proof”.

### Slide 10 — The Opportunity (why Doug is uniquely positioned)
Doug is a rare diaspora branch:
- Poland roots (Trzemeszno), then US records are accessible (census, naturalization, parish)
- His Big Y result becomes a **reference point** for the entire Skory paternal line

### Slide 11 — The Plan (simple + respectful)
1) Doug upgrades to **Big Y‑700** at FTDNA  
2) We help interpret results (tree placement, matches, timeline)  
3) We deliver a short “family report” (1–2 pages) + optional deep dive

### Slide 12 — Call to Action (and “make it easy”)
Option A: Doug funds it as a legacy gift.  
Option B: Family sponsors it (Judith/Libby + any relatives split).  
Option C: “Sponsor now, decide later”: place order first; analysis happens when results arrive.

Close with:
“If you’re willing, we can have the order placed this week. I’ll help with every step.”

### Slide design guidance (for a “super cool” feel)
Keep it modern and clean:
- 1 idea per slide; large headings; 1–3 bullets
- Use a single color theme (deep navy + gold accents works well with “history” themes)
- Use maps/timelines instead of “royal claims”
Suggested visuals:
- Map: Trzemeszno (PL) → (possible Ukraine waypoint) → Michigan (US)
- Timeline: 950–1020 (Bodzia era) → 1700s–1900s (records era) → today (DNA era)
- A simple Y‑tree diagram: “STR hints” → “SNP confirms”

## 5) NotebookLM Prompts (copy/paste)

### Prompt A — Generate a “cool” slide deck
Create a 12-slide presentation for Douglas Skory and his family to persuade them to fund (or co-fund) an FTDNA Big Y‑700 upgrade. Requirements:
1) Use a warm, respectful tone (not salesy).
2) Keep claims accurate: Vikings/Bodzia/Kievan Rus/Piast are historical context and hypotheses, not proven descent.
3) Use the strongest hard evidence: the reported Y‑STR distances and the I‑Y45113 / I‑Y224059 / I‑Y45233 context.
4) Include a clear call-to-action and a simple “how to do it” step list.
5) Provide speaker notes per slide (30–60 seconds each).

### Prompt B — 3-minute narration script
Write a 3-minute narration script for the deck that:
- Hooks with “one test can answer a centuries-old question”
- Explains Y111 vs Big Y‑700 simply
- Includes one “wow” moment (migration + records + genetics coming together)
- Ends with a gentle ask to sponsor the test

### Prompt C — One-page family summary handout
Create a one-page handout titled “Why Big Y‑700 for the Skory Line?” with:
- What we know now
- What Big Y answers
- What it costs and what they get
- What we will do (analysis + report)
- A short disclaimer about historical hypotheses

### Prompt D — Funding options slide + message variants
Create 3 funding options (Doug funds; family split; sponsor-pool) and produce:
1) One slide with those options
2) 3 short message variants (direct ask, soft ask, “no pressure” ask)

### Prompt E — FAQ (handle skepticism)
Write an FAQ for Doug’s family answering:
- What Big Y‑700 is (vs Y111)
- What you get back
- How long it takes
- Privacy concerns and what we will/won’t do with results
- What happens if the result does NOT match the hypothesis
- Why Bodzia/Vikings are mentioned (and why that is not a claim)

### Prompt F — Phone/voicemail script (45 seconds)
Write a 45-second voicemail script that is friendly, non-pushy, and asks for a quick call about the Big Y‑700 upgrade.

## 6) Email to Send (short + effective)

Subject: One test to unlock the Skory paternal line (Big Y‑700)

Hi Doug (and Judith/Libby),

I put together a short presentation showing what we already know from the Y‑DNA results and what the Big Y‑700 upgrade would uniquely answer (exact branch + timeline + closest matches). It also shows how this connects to the larger historical context we’ve been exploring (Vikings / Rus / Piast era)—clearly labeled as “testable hypotheses”, not claims.

If you’re open to it, Big Y‑700 would turn your Y111 results into a precise placement on the Y‑DNA tree and would be a lasting reference point for the entire Skory paternal line.

Would you be willing to sponsor the Big Y‑700 upgrade (or split it among family)? I’m happy to help with the order and share a short family report once results are in.

Best,  
Andrzej

### Alternate email variant (Doug funds it himself; simplest logistics)
Subject: Big Y‑700 upgrade — simplest path is you order in your FTDNA account

Hi Doug,

Quick update: Aleksei’s January 2026 note confirmed the Big Y upgrade still wasn’t placed, but your Y‑STR distances remain very compelling. The simplest way to move forward is for you to order the Big Y‑700 upgrade directly in your FTDNA account (family can still chip in afterward if you want).

If you do it, I’ll handle the interpretation and send you a short, family-friendly report (your exact SNP branch, closest matches, and a timeline estimate). The Vikings/Bodzia/Rus/Piast angle in my presentation is presented only as historical context and testable questions, not claims.

Would you be open to placing the order this week?

Best,  
Andrzej

### Alternate email variant (family split)
Subject: Big Y‑700 for the Skory line — can we split it as a family?

Hi Judith and Libby (and Doug),

Would you be open to splitting the cost of Doug’s Big Y‑700 upgrade as a family “legacy project”? Doug already has Y111; Big Y would finally place the Skory paternal line precisely on the Y‑DNA tree.

If you’re willing, Doug can approve the upgrade in his FTDNA account and the family can reimburse/sponsor the cost. I’ll provide a short, shareable family report once results come in.

Best,  
Andrzej

---

## 7) “How to Order” Checklist (FTDNA)

Keep this as an appendix slide or speaker note:
- Log in to FTDNA (Doug’s account)
- Find upgrade options → **Big Y‑700**
- Confirm shipping address + privacy settings
- Submit order / payment
- When kit arrives: swab + mail back

Notes:
- Pricing can change; treat $239 as the historical quoted cost in the 2021–2022 discussion.
- If Doug prefers not to manage the order, the family can still sponsor it, but Doug must approve the upgrade in his account.

---

## 8) Optional “Cool Factor” Add-ons (if you want extra persuasion)

Add one “deliverable promise” slide:
- A clean family tree graphic (paternal line) + a one-page “What changed after Big Y”
- A timeline graphic: “~1000 years → ~700 years → our most recent split”

Keep it grounded: the visuals are about *evidence and timelines*, not crowns and certainty.

---

## 9) Extra scripts you can paste into NotebookLM (optional)

### Short “wow moment” paragraph (use in narration)
“This isn’t about proving we descend from a king—it’s about using one modern test to place our paternal line precisely on the tree, then letting history be a set of testable questions. If we learn Doug’s exact SNP branch, we can focus our search in the right places and time periods, and we can compare responsibly to published ancient datasets. It’s a legacy result that your family can reuse forever.”

### If Doug is hesitant (respectful fallback)
“If Big Y feels like too much right now, no worries—could you share a screenshot/export of your Y111 values so we can compare markers directly? That would still help us test the Wladyslaw ↔ Doug closeness Aleksei mentioned.”
